<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>American slavery is a great sin&mdash;a complicated iniquity&mdash;a
gigantic barbarism&mdash;and it &ldquo;is evil, only evil, and that continually.&rdquo;
But the depth of this wickedness is not very frequently
sounded, if, indeed it can be sounded. The magnitude
of this crime is not often measured, if, indeed it is possible to
determine its dimensions.</p>

<p>Slavery has narcoticized the consciences of the American
people to a most alarming extent. A deep sleep has come over
the moral sense, which it would seem cannot be broken by the
cries and entreaties of three millions of wretched bondmen.
Are we not in imminent danger of being cursed with Pharaoh&rsquo;s
hardness of heart? May we not be visited speedily with judicial
blindness such as was inflicted upon the doomed nations and
cities of antiquity?</p>

<p>The standard of national morality has been degraded to the
level of an infamous lower law enacted by scheming political
traders.</p>

<p>Our national government, in all its departments&mdash;Executive,
Judicial and Legislative&mdash;has been transformed into a pliant
tool in the hands of an unscrupulous oligarchy.</p>

<p>The powerful American Churches have ceased to be asylums
for the oppressed, defenders of the down trodden, uncompromising
foes of tyranny, and they have become, on the contrary,
the apologists of oppressors, a terror to the oppressed, and the
only reliable bulwark of American slavery.</p>

<p>The author has aimed to present in the following pages such
a discussion of the general subject of slavery as would be cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>culated
to awaken the thoughts, and feelings, especially of those
who have not had an opportunity of examining this question in
larger and more ably written productions. There are thousands
of honest people who would take a decided position on a Christian
anti-slavery platform, and throw their whole influence in
the right direction if they were made acquainted with slavery
as it is, and with their duties religiously and politically in relation
to it. It is with the design of benefiting the common
people&mdash;the people of plain sense&mdash;who are not offended at plain
talk and plain facts, that the following work is published. If
the workingmen of the free and slave States can be aroused into
action, slavery must fly from the churches and perish from the
nation.</p>

<p>With this purpose in view, we have sketched a history of the
African slave trade, showing how slavery originated; have
defined slavery&mdash;proving that its essential principle is property
in a human being; and laws, facts and incidents have been
adduced to illustrate the system so that even a child may see and
feel its enormity.</p>

<p>And, as a corrupt moral sense has been still more corrupted
by efforts to bring revealed religion to the support of slavery,
particular pains have been taken to prove that not a single word,
nor precept, nor example can be adduced from the Bible which
sanctions any such system; and that the whole spirit of religion
as revealed under the old economy and the new, is utterly and
irreconcilably opposed to all slavery.</p>

<p>It has been thought proper to present a concise view of the
position occupied by the American Churches upon this question.
No church can complain when its ecclesiastical action on so
grave a subject is re-published. And besides, it is quite necessary
for honest people to know on what platforms the religious
denominations of the country stand.</p>

<p>The true position of a religious society or church in relation to
slavery is exhibited. This is a point of more than ordinary
importance. The doctrine is maintained that the honor of the
Bible, the purity, power, peace, and success of the Church, its
duty to God, to freedom, to slaveholders and especially to slaves,
demand that it have no fellowship with slaveholding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p>Particular pains have been taken to point out the political
duties of Christians in relation to slavery.</p>

<p>The inquiry, &ldquo;how are we to get rid of slavery?&rdquo; is taken up,
and the position assumed and defended that it ought to be
abolished immediately.</p>

<p>The book closes with a glance at the prospects. The watchman
tells us that the sky from many points of observation is
dark, but still that there are some very encouraging indications.
The uncorrupted conscience, reason, truth, Christianity and
prayer, are on the side of the oppressed; and God, who is love,
is their hope, and cannot fail to come to their help and bring
them forth with a mighty hand and an out-stretched arm.</p>

<p>Quite a number of works on slavery have been consulted in
the preparation of this discussion, among which may be mentioned,
&ldquo;American Slave Code&rdquo; by Mr. Goodell; &ldquo;Barnes on
Slavery;&rdquo; &ldquo;Bible Servitude,&rdquo; by E. Smith; &ldquo;Elliott on American
Slavery;&rdquo; &ldquo;Slavery and the Church,&rdquo; by Mr. Hosmer;
&ldquo;Debate on Slavery by Blanchard &amp; Rice;&rdquo; &ldquo;Non-fellowship
with Slaveholders,&rdquo; by Mr. Fee; &ldquo;Sermon on the Slave Trade&rdquo;
by Jonathan Edwards; and &ldquo;Thirteenth Annual Report of the
American and Foreign Anti-slavery Society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No &ldquo;mealy words&rdquo; have been used in this book. I have
only aimed to present the plain truth, and shall be rewarded in
whatever mite of influence it may cast on the side of liberty.</p>

Origin of American Slavery.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SLAVE TRADE.</span></h2>

<p>On the continent of America and adjacent
Islands there are more than seven millions
of slaves. Between three and four millions
of these are enslaved by the most liberal, enlightened
and prosperous nation on the Globe.
The American <i>Republic</i> is a great slaveholding
nation, and, viewed in its slaveholding character,
might fitly be termed also, the American
<i>Despotism</i>. The highest form of freedom is
here enjoyed by about twenty millions of persons
and the lowest type of slavery suffered
by more than three millions. One seventh of
all born under our Democratic Constitution
and under our world-renowned stars and
stripes, are hereditary slaves.</p>

<p>American slavery has flourished three hundred
years, being coeval with the Reformation,
and running back over one twentieth part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the whole period of time since Adam. Nine
generations of slaves, under a crushing weight
of despotism, have toiled and suffered on
through a wretched life, and have gone murmuring
down to the grave.</p>

<p>We shall now inquire into the origin of this
immense iniquity. American slavery originated
directly in the African slave trade; a trade
most dishonorable to human nature, bad as
that nature is admitted to be, and most disgraceful
to christian civilization. Its history,
although not fully written, except by heaven&rsquo;s
recording angel, cannot be read by a humane
person, even in its fragmentary form,
without the deepest sorrow. It is a history of
villainy, of relentless cruelty, of raging, hollow-hearted
avarice and of unmitigated diabolism
on the one side; and of wrongs, wretchedness
and writhing anguish on the other.</p>

<p>Nothing had occurred to provoke a marauding
attack upon the Africans. They were a
peaceable and harmless people, and had no
means of exciting either the jealousy or the
displeasure of Europeans. They had not violated
treaties, nor declared wars. The bloody
wars among the African tribes, of which we
hear so much from those who would palliate the
atrocities of the slave trade, were excited by the
traders themselves, and so far from palliating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
only add <i>blackness</i> to the darkness of their
crimes. The old Roman soldier, who enslaved
a national enemy whom he valiantly met and
conquered in what is called honorable warfare,
might have claimed, with the semblance of
plausibility, that the life he had spared legitimately
belonged to him. But the African
slave trader could not plead even this unmanly
and unmerciful apology. The Africans were
not national enemies, and were not in arms.</p>

<p>No, it was not revenge, ambition, or patriotism,
but <span class="small">CUPIDITY</span> which prompted the slave
trade&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;The lust of gold, unfeeling and remorseless!</div>
<div class="i0">The last corruption of degenerate man.&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Avaricious men launched and manned the
slave ship, unfurled the sails and stood at the
helm. In their perilous voyage over the wide
ocean, amid storms and tempests, not one noble
impulse swelled their bosoms; not one philanthropic
purpose strengthened their courage;
not one humane pulsation throbbed in their
hearts. The slaver went on its long voyage under
the patronage of the Prince of darkness,
for the one and only purpose of making gold
out of the sale of the bodies and souls of men;
of distilling wealth from blood and tears and
agony. Montgomery said truly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;Cruel as death, insatiate as the grave,</div>
<div class="i0">False as the winds that round his vessel blow;</div>
<div class="i0">Remorseless as the gulf that yawns below,</div>
<div class="i0">Is he who toils upon the wafting flood,</div>
<div class="i0"><span class="smcap">A Christian broker in the trade of blood</span>!&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it was not avarice in the crew of the
slave ship alone which incited and drove this
iniquitous business. The prime movers were
the owners of the estates to be worked. Had
those men been unwilling to grow rich upon
unrewarded toil, the <i>slaver</i> never would have
sailed to Africa and plundered its shores. But
the piratical crew and the purchasers of the
victims of their nefarious traffic were in a villainous
co-partnership.</p>

<p>When the slaver had reached its destination
and had anchored off the slave coast, the following
methods were employed in securing a
cargo. 1st. Declarations of friendship were
made and many of the unsuspecting natives
were induced, out of curiosity or for trade, to go
aboard the vessel, and when there were suddenly
confined and permitted no more to return.
2d. Parties of the crew were sent out to surprise
and carry off innocent children and youth
as they went to the fields or gathered in groups
to play in the groves. Think of the anguish
of those African mothers and of the distress of
their affrighted children! 3d. Villages were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
fired in the night, and as many of the defenseless
inhabitants as could be captured by force
of arms were carried off. 4th. The chiefs of
different tribes were hired to act as the agents
of the slaver in procuring slaves. Rum, of
which all savages are extremely fond, was the
principal incentive. Inflamed by this demon,
the native chiefs made war upon each other,
and sold the prisoners captured to the traders
for a fresh supply of rum.</p>

<p>The African slave trade was commenced on
a small scale a few years before the discovery
of America. We learn from the Encyclopedia
Americana &ldquo;that, in 1434, a Portuguese captain
name <i>Alonzo Gonzales</i>, landed in Guinea,
and carried away some colored lads, whom he
sold advantageously to Moorish families settled
in the South of Spain. Six years after, he
committed a similar robbery, and many merchants
imitated the practice, and built a fort
to protect the traffic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a discovery of the Gold Mines of
America, quite a number of negroes were imported,
first by the Portuguese then by the
Spaniards, to labor in those mines. In 1511
Ferdinand, King of Spain, authorized the importation
of a large number. About this period
it is said, and generally believed that <i>Bartolomeo
las Cas</i>, a Catholic Priest, influenced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a feeling of pity toward the Indians, whom
the Spaniards were enslaving, proposed to
Ximenes the regular importation of negroes.
Whether this be true or not, Charles the V. in
1517, granted the privilege to Lebresa, of importing
4000 slaves to America annually. Lebresa
sold his right to import to Genoese
merchants, for about $25,000. These merchants
now commenced the slave trade in
earnest.</p>

<p><i>Sir John Hawkins</i> has the honor of being the
first English captain who engaged in the business
of stealing negroes. In 1556 he made
an unsuccessful effort at negro catching near
Cape Verd. He made another effort at a different
point; and after burning the towns, was
so bravely resisted by the inhabitants, that he
lost seven men, and only captured ten. He
continued his depredations until his ship was
loaded with human beings, which he sold in
America.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The trade was now vigorously
prosecuted by the christian nations of Europe.
It is said that Charles the V., Louis XIII. and
Queen Elizabeth had some trouble with their
consciences about this horrible trade, but they
were quieted by the argument that it brought
the African into a good situation to be converted!
Pope Leo X. declared that &ldquo;not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
christian religion but nature itself cried out
against a State of slavery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These feeble expressions of disapprobation
were scarcely heard and the trade went on vigorously&mdash;cupidity
triumphing over conscience
and silencing almost, for many years, the voice
of humanity and religion.</p>

<p>An extract from a sermon preached on the
slave trade by <i>President Edwards</i>, in the year
1791 will now be quoted. At the time this
good man lifted his voice against this traffic,
it will be remembered that it was authorized
by the Constitution of the United States, and
was a source of great profit to those engaged
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The slave trade is wicked and abominable
on account of the cruel manner in which it is
carried on. Beside the stealing or kidnapping
of men, women and children, in the first instance,
and the instigation of others to this
abominable practice, the inhuman manner in
which they are transported to America, and in
which they are treated on the passage and in
their subsequent slavery, is such as ought forever
to deter every man from acting any part
in this business, who has any regard to justice
or humanity. They are crowded so closely into
the holds and between the decks of vessels,
that they have room scarcely to lie down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
some times not room to sit up in an erect posture,
the men at the same time fastened together
with irons, by two and two: and all this in the
most sultry climate. The consequence of the
whole is, that the most dangerous and fatal diseases
are soon bred among them, whereby
vast numbers of those exported from Africa
perish in the voyage; others in dread of that
slavery which is before them, and in distress
and despair from the loss of their parents, their
children, their husbands, their wives, all their
dear connections, and their dear native country
itself, starve themselves to death, or plunge
themselves into the ocean. Those who attempt
in the former of those ways to escape
from their persecutors, are tortured by live
coals placed to their mouths. Those who attempt
an escape in the latter and fail, are equally
tortured by the most cruel beating. If any
of them make an attempt as they sometimes
do, to recover their liberty, some, and as the
circumstance may be, many, are put to immediate
death, others, beaten, bruised, cut and
mangled in a most inhuman and shocking manner,
are in this situation, exhibited to the rest,
to terrify them from the like attempt in future:
and some are delivered up to every species of
torment, whether by the application of the
whip, or of any other instrument, even of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
itself, as the ingenuity of the ship master, or
of his crew is able to suggest, or their situation
will admit; and these torments are purposely
continued for several days before death is permitted
to afford relief to these objects of vengeance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By these means, according to the common
computation, twenty-five thousand, which is a
fourth part of those who are exported from
Africa, and by the concession of all, twenty
thousand, annually perish, before they arrive
at the places of their destination in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same writer computed that of the one
hundred thousand slaves annually exported,
60,000 were captives taken in war, and that
ten persons were killed in the capture of one.
<i>Sixty thousand then in the time of Jonathan Edwards
were slain in battle, 40,000 destroyed on the
voyage</i> and in the seasoning, making <i>an annual
destruction of</i> 100,000 men, woman and children,
in order to procure 60,000 slaves! This
computation may be relied upon, as Jonathan
Edwards was a careful writer, and no enthusiast.</p>

<p>For three hundred years this horrible traffic
had been prosecuted before Mr. Edwards
delivered the sermon from which we have
quoted, and at that period the annual slaughter
was 100,000, and the annual enslave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>ment
60,000! How many perished during
those three hundred years God only
knows. Rum had excited wars among the natives,
and the whole coast, and far into the interior
was turned into a battle field. No one was
safe. The poor African could not lie down
securely at night, for men-stealers were ransacking
the country watching for their prey
like hungry tigers; villages were burned, property
destroyed, and the wretched inhabitants,
either captured, killed, or caused to fly from
their homes, and perish perhaps with famine.</p>

<p>In a report made to the British House of
Commons, it was estimated that from 1807 to
1847, including a period of only forty years,
<i>ten millions</i> of persons had been made the victims
of this traffic! <span class="smcap">Ten millions</span>; one-half of
whom were murdered in Africa; one fourth during
the &ldquo;middle passage;&rdquo; and the remaining
fourth reduced to <i>property</i> and doomed, with
their posterity, to a life of degradation, suffering
and toil! And all this gigantic robbery
and murder perpetrated in the favored nineteenth
century!</p>

<p>Permit me to direct your attention to a
single slave ship which sailed only a few
years ago. This ship was examined by the
officers of a British man-of-war. The follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>ing
is from the pen of Mr. Walsh, an eye witness
of what he relates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship had taken in, on the coast of Africa,
336 males and 226 females, making in all
562, and had been out 17 days, during which
she had thrown overboard <i>fifty five</i>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The slaves were all enclosed under grated
hatchways between decks. The space was so
low, that they sat between each other&rsquo;s legs,
and they were stowed so close together, that
there was no possibility of their lying down, or
at all changing their position by night or day.
As they belonged to, and were shipped on account
of different individuals, they were all
branded like sheep, with the owner&rsquo;s marks of
different forms. These were impressed under
their breasts or on their arms, and as the mate
informed me, with perfect indifference, quiemados
pelo ferro quento&mdash;burnt with the red hot
iron. Over the hatchway stood a ferocious
looking fellow with a scourge of many twisted
thongs in his hand, who was the slave driver of
the ship; and whenever he heard the slightest
noise below, he shook it over them, and seemed
eager to exercise it. As soon as the poor
creatures saw us looking down at them their
dark and melancholy visages brightened up.
They perceived something of sympathy and
kindness in our looks which they had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
accustomed to, and feeling instinctively, that
we were friends, they immediately began to
shout and clap their hands. One or two had
picked up a few Portuguese words, and cried
out <i>Viva! viva!</i> The women were particularly
excited. They all held up their arms;
and when we bent down and shook hands with
them, they could not contain their delight, they
endeavored to scramble upon their knees,
stretching up to kiss our hands; and we understood
that they knew we had come to liberate
them. Some, however, hung down their heads,
in apparently hopeless dejection, some were
greatly emaciated, and some, particularly children,
seemed dying. But the circumstance
which struck us most forcibly, was, how it was
possible for such a number of human beings
to exist, packed up and wedged together as
tight as they could cram, in low cells, three
feet high, the greater part of which, except that
immediately under the hatchways, was shut
out from light or air, and this when the thermometer,
exposed to the open sky, was stand-in
the shade, on our deck at 89°. The space
between the decks was divided into two compartments,
three feet, three inches high; the
size of one was 16 feet by 18 feet, and of the
other 40 feet by 21 feet; into the first there
were crammed the women and girls, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
second the men and boys; 226 fellow beings
were thus thrust into one space 288 feet square,
and 336 into another 800 feet square, giving to
the whole an average of 23 inches, and to each
of the women, not more than thirteen. The
heat of these horrid places was so great and
the odor so offensive, that it was quite impossible
to enter them even had there been room.
They were measured as above when the slaves
had left them. The officers insisted that the
poor suffering creatures should be admitted on
deck to get air and water. This was opposed
by the mate of the slaver, who, from a feeling
that they deserved it, declared they would murder
them all. The officers (of the Eng. ship,)
however, persisted, and the poor beings were
all turned up together. It is impossible to conceive
the effect of this eruption; 507 fellow
creatures of all ages and sizes, some children,
some adults, old men and women, all in a state
of total nudity, scrambling out together to
taste a little pure air and water. They came
swarming up like bees from the aperture of a
hive, till the whole deck was crowded to suffocation,
from stem to stern; so that it was impossible
to imagine where they could all have
come from, or how they could all have been
stowed away. On looking into the places
where they had been crammed, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
found some children next the sides of the ship,
in the places most remote from light and air;
they were lying in nearly a torpid state, after
the rest had turned out. The little creatures
seemed indifferent as to life or death; and
when they were carried on deck, many of them
could not stand. After enjoying, for a short
time, the unusual luxury of air, some water was
brought; it was then that the extent of their
sufferings was exposed in a fearful manner.
They all rushed like maniacs toward it. No
entreaties, or threats, or blows could restrain
them; they shrieked, and struggled, and fought
with one another, for a drop of this precious
liquid, as if they grew rabid at the sight of it.
When the poor creatures were ordered down
again, several of them came, and pressed their
heads against our knees, with looks of the
greatest anguish, at the prospect of returning
to the horrid place of suffering below.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But the English ship was obliged to release the
slaver and abandon to despair those defenseless
victims, as it was found upon examination that
it had not violated a vile privilege then allowed
Brazilian ships to obtain slaves south of a
certain line.</p>

<p>It is a humiliating fact that for a period of
three centuries the whole christian world was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
engaged in plundering a heathen shore of its
inhabitants, speculating in their bodies and
souls and spreading amongst them intemperance,
war and all unutterable woes. The history
of this wickedness will never be fully
known until the general judgment. Then will
the ocean have a tale to tell of the thousands
who were smothered in the slave prisons
which floated upon her bosom, and of the multiplied
thousands who were famished and
buried in her deeps. The sea will send up her
witnesses, and Africa, wet with tears and blood,
will bear a testimony before God in that day
which will make the ears of all that hear it to
tingle!</p>

<p>But let us glance at a more hopeful view of
the subject. In 1783 a petition was addressed
to the house of Parliament, Great Britain, for
the abolition of this trade. <span class="smcap">Thomas Clarkson</span>
was the mover, and the great champion of the
cause. In 1788 Mr. Pitt presented a petition
against the trade and introduced the subject of
its abolition into the house of Commons. The
opposition to this measure was united, powerful
and violent. At length in 1792 the house of
Commons passed a bill for the abolition of the
slave trade to take place in 1795. This bill
was rejected in the House of Lords. About
this time the <i>National Assembly</i> in France, de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>clared
all the slaves in the French colonies free.
Mr. Wilberforce brought into the British Parliament
another bill in 1796, which provided
that this trade should be abolished forever after
1797&mdash;but this bill was lost also. The efforts
of the friends of humanity were redoubled, and
in &ldquo;<i>1806 Fox moved that the House of Commons
should declare the slave trade inconsistent with
justice, humanity and sound policy, and immediately
take effective measures for its abolition</i>.&rdquo;
This measure passed by a large majority&mdash;and
Jan. 1808 was fixed as the time for its abolition.
<i>In 1824 a law was passed declaring the trade to be
piracy.</i> Portugal provided for the total abolition
of this trade in 1823. France in 1815&mdash;Spain
in 1820&mdash;Netherlands in 1818&mdash;Sweden
in 1813&mdash;Brazil in 1830&mdash;Denmark in 1804.
The United States prohibited it by Constitution
in 1809&mdash;and in 1814 engaged by the treaty
of Ghent to do all in her power for its entire
suppression.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding these praiseworthy efforts,
the trade continued, and with increased
barbarity, and is even yet carried on to some
extent in defiance of all the navies of the world.</p>

<p>We have now seen that <i>avarice</i> was at the
bottom of the slave trade; that it was an unprovoked
and unparalleled outrage upon the
Africans; that it was prosecuted without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
slightest regard to the comfort or lives of the
captured; that the whole civilized world, after
an experience of centuries, became horrified at
its terrible iniquity; that now the trade is declared
to be PIRACY; that the slave-ship
can be protected by no flag under heaven; and
that all who engage in the trade may be captured
and hanged up by the neck as the most
execrable wretches.</p>

<p>Thus a traffic which received the sanction of
the Pope of Rome, and was prosecuted under
the immediate auspices of Christian kings and
governments for three centuries, was attacked
by <span class="smcap">Clarkson</span>, <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span> and other agitators,
and, though powerfully defended by avarice and
interest; though hoary with age; though protected
by statesmen, by the commercial and
planting interests, that attack was vigorously
followed up until reason, religion and humanity
felt outraged by it, and demanded in a voice
which rulers dared not refuse to hear, that it be
at once and forever abolished. So much
for agitation! Thank God for this progress!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
Slavery Defined.<br />
<span class="smaller">PROPERTY IN A HUMAN BEING.</span></h2>

<p>That we may proceed intelligently in the discussion
of the subject upon which we have entered,
it is important to understand precisely
what American slavery is. Some learned men
have confused this subject by confounding
the relation of the slave with other relations
from which it <i>essentially</i> differs. An apprentice,
a miner, hired laborer, serf or a villein is not a
slave. All these relations lack, as we shall see,
the distinguishing feature of slavery. The
slave is placed in a condition far removed from
any other class of human beings in enlightened,
civilized, or savage society. He stands in a
legal relation below all others.</p>

<p>The American slave code describes the slave
and slavery with remarkable precision and
horrible distinctness. According to that code
a slave is a <span class="small">CHATTEL</span>. He is, body, soul and
spirit, to all intents and purposes whatsoever,
<span class="small">PROPERTY</span>&mdash;the property of the master to whom
he belongs; and slavery is that &ldquo;peculiar institution&rdquo;
which, originating in piracy, systematically
despoils human beings of their manhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&mdash;of
all inborn rights, degrades them to the
state of chattelhood, and forcibly detains them
in that degradation. <span class="smcap">Property in a human creature</span>
is the <i>essential</i> and <i>peculiar</i> principle of
slavery. This is the basis of the system, and
all laws, regulations, usages, deprivations,
wrongs, sins, sufferings and miseries which belong
to the system are built upon this foundation.
Numerous and cruel systems of oppression
have existed but not one of them has
ventured to lay sacrilegious hands upon &ldquo;the
image of God,&rdquo; and convert it into a <i>thing</i> to
be bought, sold, executed for debt, willed, and
used as an article of merchandise. Slavery
alone has done this. Some authorities will
now be cited to prove the correctness of this
definition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cardinal principle of slavery, that the
slave is not to be ranked among sentient beings
but among things, obtains in all these (slave)
states.&rdquo; (<i>Judge Stroud.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slaves shall be claimed, held, taken, reputed,
and adjudged in law, to be chattels personal
in the hands of their owners and possessors,
and their executors, administrators and assigns
to all intents and purposes whatsoever.&rdquo; (<i>Law
of South Carolina.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A slave is one who is in the power of the
master to whom he belongs; the master may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
sell him, dispose of his person, his industry,
and his labor; he can do nothing, possess nothing
nor acquire anything but what must belong
to his master.&rdquo; (<i>Law of Louisiana.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A slave is in absolute bondage; he has no
civil rights, and can hold no property, except
at the will and pleasure of his master; a slave
is a rational being, endowed with understanding
like the rest of mankind; and whatever he
lawfully acquires, and gains possession of by
finding or otherwise, is the acquirement and
possession of his master.&rdquo; (<i>Wheeler.</i>)</p>

<p>A law of Mississippi reads thus: &ldquo;When any
sheriff or other officer shall serve an attachment
upon slaves, horses, or <i>other live stock</i>,&rdquo;
etc. &ldquo;Being property, slaves may be bought
and sold by persons capable of buying and
selling other property.&rdquo; (<i>Hon. J. K. Paulding.</i>)</p>

<p>Henry Clay said&mdash;&ldquo;I know that there is a
visionary dogma which holds that negro slaves
cannot be the subject of property. I shall not
dwell on the speculative abstraction. <i>That is
property which the law declares to be property.</i>
Two hundred years of legislation have sanctified
and sanctioned negro slaves as property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any one who will take up a southern newspaper
will soon discover from the manner in
which slaves are advertised for <i>sale</i>, that the
laws which reduce them to chattels are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<i>dead</i> statutes. An advertisement in the Richmond
(Va.) Whig, is headed thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Large sale of negroes, horses mules and
cattle.&rdquo; Among the articles to be sold are, 175
negroes, among whom are some carpenters and
blacksmiths, 10 horses, 33 mules, 100 head of
cattle, 100 sheep and 200 hogs. &ldquo;The negroes
will be sold for cash, the <i>other property</i> on a
credit of nine months.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Whole volumes of such advertisements might
be collected from the most respectable and
widely circulated southern journals, and I have
seen a few advertisements for the sale of men
women and children, hogs, corn and cattle promiscuously,
in respectable religious papers,
sustained by churches whose leading avowed
object is, to &ldquo;spread scriptural holiness over
these lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And slaves are not only advertised but
actually <i>sold as property is sold</i>. Raising slaves
for the market, selling them, speculating upon
them and driving them from one State to another,
creates an extensive and lucrative trade.
The <i>Virginia Times</i> estimated that in 1836 the
number of slaves exported from Virginia alone
was <i>forty thousand</i>&mdash;worth $24,000,000. The
<i>Natchez Courier</i> estimated that in 1836 two
hundred and fifty thousand slaves had been
imported into Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
and Arkansas, from the more Northern States.
The <i>Baltimore Register</i> said, &ldquo;Dealing in slaves
has become a large business; establishments
are made in several places in Md. and Va. at
which they are sold like cattle.&rdquo; Prof. Dew
said in 1831; &ldquo;Virginia is in fact a negro raising
State for the other states.&rdquo; <i>Judge Upshur</i>
of Va. said in the Va. Convention, 1831; &ldquo;The
value of slaves as an article of property, de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>pends
much on the state of the market abroad.
If it should be our lot, as I trust it will be, to
acquire the country of Texas, their price will
rise again.&rdquo; &ldquo;From the single port of <i>Baltimore</i>,&rdquo;
says Mrs. Stowe &ldquo;in the last two years,
a thousand and thirty slaves have been shipped
to the southern market.&rdquo; Slaves now
bring a very high price in cash. Only the other
day a <i>brick-layer</i> in S. C. sold for $1,905;
three others at the same sale brought over
$1000 each.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of this traffic the feelings
and interests, the parental, connubial and filial
relations of slaves are utterly disregarded.
They are sold for the benefit of the <i>master</i>, as a
horse is sold, and bought <i>to suit the purchaser</i>.
To all intents and purposes slaves are daily
bought and sold like cattle. Alas, that my pen
is compelled to write this fact.</p>

<p>A respectable gentleman (Dr. Elwood) was
an eye witness to a sale of slaves in Petersburg,
Va., in 1846. He saw some old men and women
go upon the auctioneer&rsquo;s stand to be sold
to the highest bidder. The case of a beautiful
youth affected him most deeply. &ldquo;His
hair,&rdquo; said Mr. E. &ldquo;was brown and straight, his
skin exactly the hue of white persons, and no
discernible trace of negro features in his
countenance. Some vulgar jests were passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
on his color, and 00 was bid for him; but the
audience remarked that was not enough to begin
on for such a likely young negro; some
said a white negro was more trouble than he
was worth. Before he was sold his mother
rushed from the house upon the portico, crying
in frantic grief, &lsquo;My son, O! my boy, they will
take away my dear&rsquo;&mdash;Here her voice was lost
as she was rudely pushed back and the door
closed. The sale was not for a moment interrupted,
and none of the crowd appeared to be
affected by the scene. The poor boy trembled
and wiped the tears from his cheeks with his
sleeves. He was sold for about 250 dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this boy was sold a woman was called
upon the stand. She had an infant in her arms,
but she dared not take it with her. &ldquo;She gave
it one wild embrace, before leaving it with an
old woman, and hastened mechanically to obey
the call; but stopped, threw up her arms,
screamed and was unable to move!&rdquo; Those
who know a mother&rsquo;s love can understand the
agony which raged in her maternal bosom.</p>

<p>The following is from the pen of an aged
preacher, now living in Canada, who escaped
from slavery some years since. When the
master to whom he belonged died, he, with his
fellow slaves, were put up for sale. Said he&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brothers and sisters were bid off one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
one, while my mother, holding my hand, looked
on in an agony of grief, the cause of which
I but ill understood at first, but which dawned
on my mind with dreadful clearness as the sale
proceeded. My mother was then separated
from me, and put up in her turn. She was
bought by a man named Isaac R&mdash;&mdash;, in Montgomery
county, Md., and then I was offered to
the assembled purchasers. My mother half
distracted with the parting forever from all her
children pushed through the crowd, while the
bidding for me was going on, to the spot where
R. was standing. She fell at his feet and clung
to his knees, entreating him in tones that a
mother only could command, to buy her <i>baby</i>
as well as herself, and spare to her <i>one</i> of her
little ones at least.&rdquo; But this man thus appealed
to &ldquo;disengaged himself from her with
such violent kicks and blows as to reduce her
to the necessity of creeping out of his reach
and mingling the groan of bodily suffering with
the sob of a broken heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cases are presented as examples to
show the meaning and intent of the code
which declares that a slave is <i>property</i>&mdash;and
<i>has no rights or interests</i>; and they are not rare
and extreme cases brought in here only for effect,
but are such as occur daily in all the
slave states; and they are <i>perfectly in keeping</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with the spirit of American slavery. Those
persons were sold precisely as <i>other property</i> is
sold.</p>

<p>From these authorities and facts it is clear
that a slave occupies a relation as far beneath
the apprentice, miner, hired laborer, or even
the villein of the Feudal Age, or the Russian
serf, as mere <i>property</i> is beneath <i>manhood</i> with
all its possessions and God-like powers&mdash;as far
as a brute is below a man &ldquo;made in the image
of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The American slave code is almost an exact
copy of the old savage Roman slave code,
which was conceived in the dark night of heathenism,
and brought forth reeking with blood in
the unholy travail of sanguinary wars, before
that empire had been enlightened and conquered
by the peaceful and just Gospel of Christ.
That it may be seen <i>where</i> English and American
law-makers obtained the spirit of the
American slave code, the following synopsis
of the Roman law on slavery is inserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Roman civil law, slaves were esteemed
merely as chattels of their masters;
they had no name but what the master was
pleased to give them for convenience. They
were not capable of personal injuries cognizable
by the law. They could take neither by
purchase nor descent, could have no heirs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
could make no will. The fruits of their labor
and industry belonged to their masters. They
could not plead nor be impleaded, and were
utterly excluded from all civil concerns. They
were incapable of marriage, not being entitled
to the considerations thereof. The laws of
adultery did not (among themselves) effect
them. They might be sold, transferred, mortgaged,
pawned. <i>Partus sequitur ventrem</i> was
the rule indiscriminately applied to slaves and
cattle.&rdquo; (<i>Harris and McHenry.</i>)<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>At a glance it will be seen that the Roman
and American slave codes are identical in spirit&mdash;that
the distinguishing principle of both is
property in man. Our christian legislators
therefore must acknowledge themselves indebted
to Pagan Rome for the type of slavery
which they have instituted and maintained in
Christian America. All the main features of
cruelty, injustice and savageness, inherent in
that ancient system of oppression, have been
faithfully copied, and not in the slightest degree
modified or softened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us recapitulate. A slave is property.
His bones and sinews, genius, skill, virtue,
mind, soul; all he is, all he may be, all he
acquires in this life, belongs to his master and
is put down in his ledger as worth so many
dollars. He is without choice as to what he
will do, what amount of labor he will perform,
or for whom he shall toil. He can own nothing,
inherit nothing, will nothing. He cannot
make a contract for himself, nor claim the protection
of the laws as a man. He is wholly in
the power of his master and totally defenseless
against his lusts, avarice, or brutality. I defy
human ingenuity, nay, if I may be so bold, I
challenge Lucifer himself to invent a system
of oppression which leaves a man more completely
destitute, defenseless and degraded.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHATTEL PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE.</span></h2>

<p>We will now enter more definitely into an
examination of that terrible institution which
practically justifies the African slave-trade by
holding on to its victims and substituting in its
stead an inter-state slave-trade in moral turpitude
fully equaling it; which, in a land of free
institutions, holds in galling chains more than
three millions of our dear fellow creatures;
annually robs a hundred thousand American
mothers of their babes; and despoils one hundred
thousand children every year of that precious
freedom which is their birthright and reduces
them to a level with unreasoning beasts.
Our task will be painful, but let us proceed.</p>

<p>1. <i>Slaves are denied an education.</i> I think
it is universally admitted that education and
slavery are utterly incompatible, and that total
ignorance of letters and general imbecility of
intellect are essential to its successful continuance,
and indeed, its very existence in any country.
Hence in the United States, where millions
of dollars are annually expended for
schools and colleges, and where it is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
universally believed that a sound education is
conducive to good morals, the spread of civilization,
the preservation of liberty and the progress
of Christianity, even here nothing is done
for the education of slaves. While millions of
free children are annually gathered into
schools and diligently instructed, the children
of slaves, although equally capable, are permitted
to grow up without the least attention
to their mental culture. But this, though bad
enough, is not the worst. If slaves were at liberty
to follow out their own inclinations, they might
many of them, even without encouragement or
help, acquire a respectable education. But
the laws <i>punish the slave with great severity who,
with any motive or under any circumstances</i>, may
attempt to learn to read or write, and also
any person who may teach him.</p>

<p>Some of the laws and opinions relating to
the education of slaves, (free negroes generally
included) will now be cited. &ldquo;Virginia Revised
Code of 1819. That all meetings or assemblages
of slaves or free negroes, or free negroes
and mulattoes mixing and associating
with such slaves at any meeting house or houses
&amp;c., in the night; or at any <i>school</i> or <i>schools</i>
for teaching them reading or writing either <i>in
the day or night</i>, under <i>whatsoever pretext</i>, shall
be deemed and considered an <span class="small">UNLAWFUL ASSEM<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>BLY</span>;
and any justice of a county wherein such
assemblage shall be, shall issue his warrant,
directed to any sworn officer or officers, authorizing
him or them to enter the house or houses
where such unlawful assemblages may be, for
the purpose of apprehending or dispersing such
slaves, and to inflict <i>corporal punishment</i> on the
offender or offenders, at the discretion of any
justice of the peace not exceeding twenty lashes.&rdquo;
(<i>Goodell&rsquo;s American Slave Code.</i>)</p>

<p>No person in Virginia is allowed to open a
school for the instruction of colored persons or
to teach them to read and write under a penalty
of $100 and six months imprisonment. It
may be thought that these laws are not now
enforced and stand as a dead letter upon the
statute book. But the following cool item of
news published in the <i>Richmond Examiner</i> under
date of May 12th, 1853, will satisfy any one
that they are enforced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Breaking up a Negro School.</span>&mdash;The officers
at Norfolk made a descent on Tuesday upon a
negro school, kept in the neighborhood of the
Stone Bridge, by a Mrs. Douglass and her
daughter, and the teachers, together with their
sable pupils, were taken before his Honor.
They acknowledged their guilt, but pleaded ignorance
of the law, and were discharged, on a
promise to do so no more; a very convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
way of getting out of the scrape. The law of
this State imposes a fine of one hundred dollars,
and imprisonment for six months, for such
offenses; is positive, and allows no discretion
in the committing magistrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If a free negro in North Carolina attempt to
teach a slave to read, or if he give to a slave a
religious tract, a spelling book or the bible, he
may be imprisoned or take <i>thirty-nine lashes</i>!
If a white person attempt to teach a slave the
laws subject him to a fine of $200 for each offense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Georgia, if a white teach a free negro
or a slave to write he is fined $500, and imprisoned
at the discretion of the Court; if the
offender be a colored man, bond or free, he
may be fined or whipped at the discretion of
the Court. This law was enacted in 1829.&rdquo;
(<i>Jay&rsquo;s Inquiry.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Louisiana the penalty for teaching slaves
to read and write is one year&rsquo;s imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In North Carolina, the patrols were ordered
to search every negro house for books or
prints of every kind. Bibles and hymn books
were particularly mentioned.&rdquo; (<i>Goodell.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said Mr. Berry in the Va. House
of Delegates, &ldquo;<i>as far as possible closed every avenue
by which light may enter their minds. If we
could extinguish the capacity</i> to see the light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
our work would be completed; they would then
be on a level with the beasts of the field and
we would be safe! I am not certain that we
would not do it, if we could find out the process,
<i>and that on the plea of necessity</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Frederick Douglass was a slave and
belonged to Mr. Auld, his mistress, who had
been lately married, manifested toward him
true womanly kindness and commenced to
teach him the art of reading. &ldquo;But when my
master heard of it,&rdquo; says Douglass in his Narrative,
&ldquo;he at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct
me further, telling her among other things, that
it was unlawful, as well as unsafe to teach a
slave to read. To use his own words further
he said, &lsquo;If you give a nigger an inch he will
take an ell. A nigger should know nothing
but to obey his master&mdash;to do as he is told to
do. Learning would spoil the best negro in
the world. Now, said he, if you teach that nigger
(speaking of myself,) how to read there
would be no keeping him. It would forever
unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become
unmanageable, and of no value to his
master. As to himself it would do him no
good, but a great deal of harm. It would
make him discontented and unhappy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is not that a terrible institution which can
only be sustained by enchaining the immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
mind and withholding entirely the advantages
of education? Think of it. A slave&rsquo;s soul, as
is often the case, is possessed with an unquenchable
passion for improvement. He has
a mind in constant unrest&mdash;active, elastic, aspiring.
A benevolent friend engages to instruct
him at night in the rudiments of learning,
but while engaged in this good work the law
seizes them, and hurries the slave to the whipping-post
and the friend to prison. Twenty,
thirty or forty lashes on the bare back are rather
poor encouragement to the student, and a
heavy fine and long imprisonment with felons
hard pay for a teacher. But slavery makes it
a crime to learn to read even the bible, and a
penitentiary offense to teach a slave the alphabet!</p>

<p>The object of this is plainly declared by Mr.
Berry of Va., viz: to close every avenue of
light from the slave&rsquo;s mind&mdash;to debase him as
low as possible&mdash;and thus put resistance out
of his power&mdash;that he may become a docile
and profitable <i>chattel</i>.</p>

<p>These laws are a bold defiance of the Almighty
who constructed the marvelous powers
of the human mind for improvement and activity
and who revealed in written language his
word for the comfort and guidance of all his
creatures. They interpose a barrier between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the slave and his Maker and thus hinder his
salvation. Even convicts in prison are taught
to read the scriptures, and in this respect slavery
is more severe with its victims than justice
is with the worst criminals.</p>

<p>2. <i>Slavery does not recognize the matrimonial
connections of slaves.</i> As slaves are to be put
as nearly as possible upon a level with &ldquo;<i>other</i>
property&rdquo; the slave code with singular meanness,
but perfect consistency, refuses to the
slave a lawful marriage, subjects him to conditions
which are inconsistent with that sacred
relation, and exposes slave wives to the unbridled
lust of masters and overseers!</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the consent of their masters slaves
may marry <span class="spaced">* * *</span> but whilst in a state
of slavery it cannot produce any <i>civil effect</i>, because
slaves are <i>deprived of all civil rights</i>.&rdquo;
(<i>Judge Mathews.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A slave cannot even contract matrimony,
the association which takes place among slaves
and is <i>called</i> marriage, being properly designated
by the word <i>contubernium</i>, a relation which
has no sanctity, and to which no civil rights
are attached.&rdquo; (<i>Judge Stroud.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A slave has never maintained an action
against the violator of his bed.&rdquo; (<i>Daniel Dulany,
Att&rsquo;y Gen. Md.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slaves were not entitled to the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of matrimony, and therefore they had no relief
in cases of adultery.&rdquo; (<i>Dr. Taylor.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marriage is a civil ordinance they cannot
enjoy. Our laws do not recognize this relation
as existing among them, and of course, do not
enforce by any sanction, the observance of its
duties. Indeed, until slavery waxeth old and
tendeth to decay, there cannot be any legal
recognition of the marriage rite, or the enforcement
of its consequent duties. For all the regulations
on this subject <i>would limit the master&rsquo;s
absolute right of property</i> in the slaves. In his
disposal of them he could no longer be at liberty
to consult merely his own interests. He
could no longer separate the wife and the husband
to suit the convenience or interest of the
purchaser.&rdquo; (<i>Address of the Synod of Ky.</i>)</p>

<p>The laws intend to make slaves absolute
property, and hence no relation is legalized
which would detract from the value of that
property. The interest of the <i>owner</i> alone is
consulted. These laws, horrible as they appear,
are entirely consistent with <i>chattel slavery</i>.
And the general <i>practice</i> upon these laws
comes up fully to their spirit. Whenever the
convenience, interest or passion of a master
requires it, slaves are sold and scattered abroad
without the slightest regard to those dear and
sacred connections, which they regard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
which God, no doubt, regards as marriage. In
newspaper advertisements for runaway slaves
it is frequently stated that the fugitive property
was bought at a certain place &ldquo;where he has
a wife,&rdquo; and the probability is that he is &ldquo;lurking
about that place.&rdquo; An advertisement in a
New Orleans paper, after describing the slave
Charles, as &ldquo;six feet high,&rdquo; &ldquo;copper color,&rdquo;
rather &ldquo;pleasing appearance,&rdquo; adds, in order
that the pursuers may have some clue to his
whereabouts, &ldquo;it is more than probable that he
will make his way to Tennessee, as he has a
wife now living there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another advertises the runaway &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; of
&ldquo;copper color, full forehead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; continues
the notice, &ldquo;was purchased in Richmond of
Mr. Goodin, and has a wife in that vicinity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another describes a runaway woman, and
suggests that she may be lurking about &ldquo;in the
country where her husband is owned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are very natural suggestions. A husband,
though a slave, and bound to his wife by
no legal tie, is not unfrequently to the slave
wife all that <i>husband</i> means, and if that wife
escape from her unfeeling oppressors, who
have carried her away to a distant State, it is
quite natural that she should bend her steps toward
the partner of her bosom, and subject
herself to incredible hardships and dangers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
she might see his face once more, and unburden
to him her sorrow-ladened heart.</p>

<p>And that wife, though a slave, unprotected by
the laws, driven by the shameful lash, insulted,
disgraced and neglected, is a <i>wife</i> still. And
when &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; as he is called, runs away, it is
quite natural that he should, impelled by a husband&rsquo;s
love, seek out the hut where years before
he had been suddenly separated from her.
These advertisements for husbands who are
supposed to be &ldquo;lurking about&rdquo; in search of
their wives, and of wives hunting for their husbands,
tell a sad tale. What husband or wife
can read them without deep sorrow?</p>

<p>The following statement from the pen of an
eye witness will illustrate scenes which are being
enacted continually in the prosecution of
the inter-state slave trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I went on board the steamboat I noticed
eight colored men, handcuffed and chained together
in pairs, four women and eight or ten
children of the apparent ages of from four to
ten years, all standing together in the bow of
the boat, in charge of a man standing near
them. <span class="spaced">* * *</span> Coming near them, I
perceived they were all greatly agitated; and,
on inquiry I found they were all slaves, who
had been born and raised in North Carolina
and had just been sold to a speculator, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
now taking them to the Charleston market.
Upon the shore there was a number of colored
persons, women and children, awaiting the departure
of the boat; and my attention was particularly
attracted by two colored females of
uncommonly respectable appearance, neatly
attired, who stood together, a little distance
from the crowd, and upon whose countenance
was depicted the keenest sorrow. As the last
bell was tolling, I saw the tears gushing from
their eyes, and they raised their neat cotton
aprons and wiped their faces under the cutting
anguish of severed affection. They were the
wives of two of the men in chains. There, too,
were mothers and sisters, weeping at the departure
of their sons and brothers; and there,
too, were fathers, taking the last look of their
wives and children. My whole attention was
directed to those on shore, as they seemed to
stand in solemn and submissive silence, occasionally
giving utterance to the intensity of
their feelings by a sigh or a stifled groan. As
the boat was loosed from her moorings, they
cast a distressed, lingering look to those on
board, and turned away in silence. My eye
now turned to those in the boat; and although
I had tried to control my feelings amidst my
sympathies for those on shore, I could conceal
them no longer, and I found myself literally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
&lsquo;weeping with those that wept.&rsquo; I stood near
them, and when one of the husbands saw his
wife upon the shore wave her hand for the last
time, in token of her affection, his manly efforts
to restrain his feelings gave way, and fixing his
watery eyes upon her, he exclaimed, &lsquo;This is
the most distressing thing of all! My dear
wife and children, farewell!&rsquo; The husband of
the other wife stood weeping in silence, and
with his manacled hands raised to his face, as
he looked upon her for the last time. Of the
poor women on board; three of them had husbands
whom they left behind. One of them
had three children, another had two, and the
third had none. These husbands and fathers
were among the throng upon the shore, witnessing
the departure of their wives and children,
and as they took their leave of them, they
were sitting together upon the floor of the boat
sobbing in silence, but giving utterance to no
complaint. But the distressing scene was not
yet ended. Sailing down the Cape Fear river
twenty-five miles, we touched at the little village
of Smithport, on the south side of the river.
It was at this place that one of these
slaves lived, and here was his wife and five
children; and while at work on Monday last,
his purchaser took him away from his family,
carried him in chains to Wilmington, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
had since remained in jail. As we approached
the wharf, a flood of tears gushed from his
eyes, and anguish seemed to have pierced his
heart. The boat stopped but a moment, and
as she left, he bid farewell to some of his acquaintances
whom he saw upon the shore, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Boys, I wish you well; tell Molly
(meaning his wife) and the children I wish them
well, and hope God will bless them.&rsquo; At that
moment he espied his wife on the stoop of a
house some rods from the shore, and with one
hand which was not in the handcuffs, he pulled
off his old hat, and waving it toward her, exclaimed,
&lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; As he saw by the waving
of her apron that she recognized him, he leaned
back upon the railing, and with a faltering
voice repeated, &lsquo;Farewell, forever.&rsquo; After a
moment&rsquo;s silence, conflicting passions seemed
to tear open his heart, and he exclaimed, &lsquo;What
have I done that I should suffer this doom?
Oh, my wife and children, I want to live no
longer!&rsquo; and then the big tear rolled down his
cheek, which he wiped away with the palm of
his unchained hand, looked once more upon
the mother of his five children, and the turning
of the boat hid her face from him forever.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ANOTHER EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget the scene which took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
place in the city of St. Louis while I was yet in
slavery. A man and his wife, both slaves,
were brought from the country to the city for
sale. They were taken to the rooms of Austin
&amp; Savage, auctioneers. Several slave speculators,
who are always to be found at auctions
where slaves are to be sold, were present.
The man was first put up and sold to the highest
bidder. The wife was next ordered to ascend
the platform. I was present. She slowly
obeyed the order. The auctioneer commenced,
and soon several hundred dollars were
bid. My eyes were intensely fixed on the face
of the woman, whose cheeks were wet with
tears. But a conversation between the slave
and his new master soon arrested my attention.
I drew near them to listen. The slave was
begging his new master to purchase his wife.
Said he, &lsquo;Master, if you will only buy Fanny
I know you will get the worth of your money.
She is a good cook, a good washer, and her
mistress liked her very much. If you will only
buy her how happy I will be!&rsquo; The new master
replied that he did not want her, <i>but, if she
sold cheap</i>, he would purchase her. I watched
the countenance of the man while the different
persons were bidding on his wife. When his
new master bid you could see the smile
on his countenance, and the tears stop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
but as another would, you could see the
countenance change, and the tears start afresh.
<span class="spaced">* *</span> But this suspense did not last long.
The wife was struck off to the highest bidder,
who proved to be not the owner of her husband.
As soon as they became aware that they were
to be separated, they both burst into tears; and
as she descended from the auction stand, the
husband walking up to her and taking her by
the hand, said, &lsquo;Well, Fanny we are to part
forever on earth. You have been a good wife
to me. I did all I could to get my new master
to buy you but he did not want you. I hope
you will try to meet me in heaven. I shall try
to meet you there.&rsquo; The wife made no reply
but her sobs and cries told too well her own
feelings.&rdquo; (<i>Narrative of William Brown.</i>)</p>

Slavery Illustrated&mdash;Continued.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHATTEL PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE.</span></h2>

<p>3. <i>Slavery disregards the parental and filial
relations.</i> The family is a type of heaven. It
is the foundation of the social system&mdash;of social
order, refinement and happiness. Destroy this
relation and the most enlightened people will
speedily relapse into barbarism. It is a God-instituted
relation, and around it Jesus Christ
has thrown the solemn sanction of his authority.
Nature implants in the hearts of parents
an affection for their offspring which is sweeter
than life and stronger than death; and this
affection, when associated with intelligence and
religion, eminently fits them to care for helpless
infancy, to guide the feet of inexperienced youth,
and to lead the opening heart and expanding
mind to virtue and to God. Without the soothing,
ennobling and virtue-inspiring influences
which emanate from the domestic hearth, this
world, I fear, would become a pandemonium.</p>

<p>But slavery, true to its leading principle, utterly
disregards and ruthlessly tramples upon
the parental and filial relations. As soon as a
child is born of a slave-mother it is put down
on the table of stock and is henceforth subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to the conditions of property. The father cannot
say&mdash;&ldquo;This is my son. I will train him up
in the fear of God, bestow upon him a liberal
education and by help divine make a true man
of him, that he may be my staff in old age.&rdquo;
No, the slaveholder has a usurped claim upon
the boy, which, in the code of the &ldquo;lower law,&rdquo;
annihilates entirely the father&rsquo;s claim. The
mother is not permitted to press the new born
babe to her throbbing bosom and rejoice over
it, saying&mdash;&ldquo;This is my daughter&mdash;I will by
the assistance of grace give her tender mind a
pious inclination, encourage her to walk in the
path of virtue and religion, to seek the &lsquo;good
part,&rsquo; chosen by Mary of old, that she may become
an ornament of her sex.&rdquo; No, that female
child is a valuable part of the planter&rsquo;s
stock, and the mother is encouraged to nurse
it well that it may bring a high price in the
market! Parents have no more to say as to
the disposition of their children than animals
have as to what shall be done with their young.
There is not a law in any State, if we may except
Louisiana, which imposes the slightest restraint
upon masters who may be disposed to
sell the children of slaves. In Louisiana an old
law prohibits the separation of slave children
from their mothers before they are ten years of
age. But this law, were it not a dead letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
as we are assured it is, would afford but a trifling
mitigation of the wrong. At any time
the master may gather up all the saleable children
on his plantation, submit them to the inspection
of a trader, strike a bargain for the
lot, and then start them off like a drove of
young cattle, without saying one word about
it to the fathers or mothers of those children.
And it often occurs that when the slave mother
returns from the field, weary with the toils of
the day, she finds her hut desolate. Where are
my children? she asks. She calls&mdash;no answer&mdash;and
is presently informed by a fellow-slave
that they are sold and gone! Yes&mdash;a christian
(?) master has taken advantage of her absence
and sent them off without giving her a parting
word with them! They shall never more return!
And yet this distressed mother has no redress.</p>

<p>Maternal love flows in a slave-mother&rsquo;s bosom
with all its wonted depth and intensity, and
the total disregard of this affection is the occasion
of the deepest sorrows recorded in the annals
of slavery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In slaveholding States, except in Louisiana
no law exists to prevent the violent separation
of parents from their children.&rdquo; (<i>Stroud.</i>) A
slave has no more legal authority over his child
than a cow has over her calf. (<i>Jay.</i>) John Davis,
a dealer in slaves at Hamburg, S. C., ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>vertises
that he has on hands, direct from Va.,
&ldquo;one hundred and twenty likely young negroes
of both sexes; among them small girls, suitable
for nurses, and several small boys without
their mothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frederick Douglass relates that &ldquo;when he
was three years old his mother was sent to
work on a plantation eight or ten miles distant,
and after that he never saw her except in the
night. After her days toil she would occasionally
walk over to her child, lie down with him in her
arms, hush him to sleep in her bosom, then rise
up and walk back again to be ready for her field
work by daylight.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Key to Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.</i></p>

<p>The following incident occurred within the
present year (1853.) We copy from the <i>Cleveland
True Democrat</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be remembered by some of our citizens
that about two or three months since, a
colored man visited our city for the purpose of
obtaining money enough to buy his child that
was held as a slave in Kentucky. Through
the generosity of J. H. Smith and his congregation,
with some added by private individuals,
the amount was raised, and the happy negro
went on his way rejoicing. Now comes the
saddest part of the tale. When the poor colored
man arrived at his home, he immediately
handed the money, to obtain which had cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
him so much labor, over to a friend, who started
immediately to Kentucky. Arriving there,
the money was laid before the master by the
gentleman, when to the utter astonishment of
the latter, the slaveholder burst into a fiendish
laugh, and said &lsquo;he&rsquo;d be &mdash;&mdash; if he would sell
the boy at any price.&rsquo; He refused all terms,
laughed at all exhortations, and finally ordered
the gentleman who wished to purchase the
boy out of the house. He left sorrowfully,
knowing how his bad success would affect the
father, who was in a delirium of joy at the
idea of seeing his long lost son. Imagine the
feeling of that man when it was communicated
to him that his boy was lost forever. Our informant
tells us that he said not a word, nor
wept; but any one familiar with a human
heart, could tell what agony that poor black
man was in. He seems to have grown ten
years older, and it is feared, unless some change
takes place, that he will soon die. His life
seems worse than death, and he loudly prays
for the latter to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The holder of that boy only did what the
laws allowed him to do, and his conduct was in
perfect consistency with <i>chattel</i> slavery. Men
can do as they like about selling the property
which the law allows them.</p>

<p>Scenes of the most provoking and heart-rend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ing
character, scenes in which humanity is outraged,
scenes which would bring the blood to
the cheek of a savage, even to behold, are enacted
in all the Southern States from day to
day, with seeming unconcern! The most bitter
cries pierce the skies and go up to heaven apparently
unheard by man. &ldquo;Here is a man, a
slave-trader, driving before him two boys with
a hickory stick, and carrying a child under his
arm. At a little distance is the <i>mother</i> with
chains on her wrists, stretching out her hand
toward the babe; but is prevented, because a
strong man holds her while she endeavors to
follow her shrieking babe and her sobbing boys.
The owner who sold the two boys, stands
calmly, unmoved, smoking a cigar, while the
overseer holds the mother, and the trader whips
off the boys and carries with him the screaming
child.&rdquo; This is precisely the way that other live
stock is sold, and those dealers are only doing
what the law allows. No one is surprised at them.
They may be respectable citizens and good
church members!</p>

<p>Christian reader, pass not over these facts
with a light heart. I beseech you to think upon
them as a man and a christian ought. You
love home, you esteem family relations the
dearest and most sacred upon earth, and you
would resist with all your power a tyranny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
which would invade your own family circle and
carry away your children for the exclusive benefit
of others. For humanity&rsquo;s sake let your
sympathies go out in behalf of the millions of
your fellow creatures who are deprived of all
the blessings of family and home. Have you
not a heart to bleed for those mothers whose
children, in tender youth, are ruthlessly torn
away from them for no higher object than the
pecuniary advantage of their masters? J. G.
Whittier, the &ldquo;slave&rsquo;s poet,&rdquo; represents in
mournful strains the Virginia slave mother&rsquo;s lament
for her daughters, sold and gone to the
far South.</p>

Slavery Illustrated&mdash;Continued.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHATTEL PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE.</span></h2>

<p>4. <i>Slavery utterly impoverishes its victims.</i>
The earth is an inheritance bestowed upon man
by the common Father of all; hence every human
being has an indefeasible right to live upon
it and to acquire a possession in it. This
right is not simply conventional, but it belongs
to man as <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>Now slavery is directly opposed to this law
of nature. It strips a slave of everything,
and of the power to acquire anything. No
one is so poor as a slave. He cannot own a
coat, or a pair of shoes, a house, or a foot of
land. No industry, economy, skill or patriotism
can release him from this state of destitu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>tion,
because it is a logical result of the relation
in which he is placed by the slave code.
Being himself a chattel, whatever he acquires
or in any way gains possession of, is, as a matter
of course, the acquirement and possession
of his master. Hence, while living in a land
of universal plenty, and toiling incessantly upon
the fruitful earth, created and adorned for
the use of every man, no alms-house pauper is
so wretchedly impoverished as the American
slave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slaves have no legal rights in things, real
or personal; but whatever they may acquire,
belongs in point of law to their masters.&rdquo;
(<i>Stroud.</i>) &ldquo;Slaves are incapable of inheriting
or transmitting property.&rdquo; (<i>Civil Code.</i>)</p>

<p>Here is a case which will illustrate the point
in hand. A slave by the name of Frederick
enlisted and fought bravely through the American
Revolution. In 1821 his name was found
on the muster roll, and a warrant was issued
granting him the soldier&rsquo;s bounty of a thousand
acres of land. Now whose land was that?
Reason and justice would answer, it belonged
to the black veteran and his heirs forever. But
the heirs of Frederick&rsquo;s old master understood
something about slave law, and brought the
case into court that it might be legally determined
who owned the bounty land. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
much learned argument, Judge Catron delivered
the following decision:&mdash;&ldquo;Frederick, the
slave of Col. Patton, earned this warrant by
his services in the continental line. <span class="smcap">What is
earned by the slave belongs to the master</span>, by
the common law, the civil law, and the recognized
rules of property in the slaveholding
States of this Union.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was an extreme case, and as Pres.
Blanchard observes, &ldquo;if Shylock&rsquo;s bond of human
flesh might have been relaxed, if ever the
laws of slavery might have been mitigated in
practice, it ought to have been in the case of
this veteran soldier.&rdquo; But the &ldquo;pound of flesh&rdquo;
was exacted. The law reducing slaves to utter
pauperism is inexorable. Poor Frederick
had no more claim to that land than Col. Patton&rsquo;s
horse had.</p>

<p>5. <i>Slavery authorizes the violation of the most
solemn contracts.</i> Strictly speaking, a slave cannot
become a party to a legal contract. His
inability to do so arises out of his relation to
society, and the evil genius which presides at all
times over legislation for slaves is very careful
to permit nothing to be enacted, unless from
absolute necessity, that can be construed into
an acknowledgment that the slave is a man
and has rights which he is authorized to maintain.
Hence a contract with a slave may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
violated with impunity. He may suffer the
most flagrant wrongs, but is barred from courts
of justice and can obtain no relief.</p>

<p>On this point the following authorities are
quoted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chancery cannot enforce a contract between
a master and his slave though the slave perform
his part.&rdquo; (<i>Wheeler.</i>) &ldquo;One principle prevails
in all the States <span class="spaced">* *</span> and that is that
a slave cannot make a contract, <i>not even the
contract of marriage</i>.&rdquo; (<i>ib.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the case of Sawney <i>vs.</i> Carter the court
refused to enforce a promise by a master to
emancipate his slave where the conditions of
the promise had been partly complied with.
The court proceeded upon the principle that it
was not competent to a court in Chancery to
enforce a contract between a master and slave,
even though the contract should be fully complied
with on the part of the slave.&rdquo; (<i>Goodell.</i>)</p>

<p>In numerous instances masters and other
white persons have taken advantage of this unjust
and malicious feature of slave law. It is
no uncommon occurrence for a slave to contract
with his master for freedom. He agrees
to raise, by extra labor, a specified sum of money
which is to be the price of his liberty. Animated
with the hope of obtaining that precious
right for which he has long sighed, he endures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
incredible hardships, toils night after night,
and, at the end of many weary years, lays before
his master a part or the whole of the price
agreed upon. Now when this is done, the master
may, in perfect accordance with American
slave law, pocket the hard-earned money and
sell the slave to the next trader, or keep him
until death in his own service. If the slave
repine at this treatment, he may be whipped
into submission. If he run away, he may be
pursued with revolvers and blood-hounds, and
we are all required by the Fugitive Slave Law
to help catch him and carry him back to his
faithless master. A case occurred within the
present year in Ky., which illustrates this odious
feature of slave law. Here is a brief statement
of the facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Norris, a colored man, has been living
in Covington about five years, has married a
free colored woman and has had by her several
children. He belongs to a Mr. J. N. Patton,
of Virginia, who permitted him to come to
Covington, and engage in whatever services
he saw proper, on condition that Sam
would pay him out of his earnings, a stipulated
sum per annum, we believe, about $100.
The surplus, whatever it might be, was to belong
to the slave. Sam was punctual for several
years. He was sober and industrious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in his humble way, very prosperous. About
two years ago Mr. Patton came west on a visit
and agreed with Sam that if he would pay him
the sum of $400 he would give him his freedom.
Sam gratefully accepted the proposal, and at
once paid down out of his hard earnings
$135 and has since given his master some $40
or $50 more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patton now comes forward to rescind the
contract and claim his slave. The case was
yesterday decided by the Hon. Judge Pryor, in
favor of Patton. In delivering his decision,
his Honor stated the following facts:</p>

<p>&ldquo;1st. That the laws of Kentucky recognize
but two modes of liberating slaves, by will and
by deeds of emancipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2d. That a slave cannot make a contract.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3d. That the contract was executory, and at
the time fixed for the negro&rsquo;s freedom, future
and contingent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4th. That so long as Sam was a slave, the
master was entitled to his services, and the
money he (Patton) had received was in law his
own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The opinion was able and elaborate, and
the authorities numerous and decided. His
Honor characterized the case as one of great
&ldquo;hardship and cruelty,&rdquo; and every one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
court room seemed to sympathize deeply with
the poor negro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lady at St. Louis, Mo., related to Mrs. F.
D. Gage the following circumstance, which
transpired in that city a short time ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had, said the lady, an old colored woman
washing for me a few years ago, for four or five
years&mdash;one of the most faithful, truthful, and
pious women, I ever knew&mdash;black or white.
She was once a slave, belonging to Davenport.
But he was a kinder man than other men, and
gave her the privilege of buying her freedom
for one thousand dollars! This sum the old
and faithful creature earned and paid herself.
Only think of it!&mdash;one thousand dollars for the
privilege of buying what our wise statesmen
call the &ldquo;inalienable right of men,&rdquo; bestowed
by the Creator. When free she stipulated for
the freedom of her son, and this, with years of
toil, she earned; and when he came to manhood
he too was free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of this, fair mothers of our land! Ye
who hug to your heart the children of your
love, and feel a mother&rsquo;s love and this for
them. You work to clothe, to school and
make comfortable those dependent upon your
care; but which of you can measure the toil
that this poor, stricken mother had to bear, ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
she filed away the galling chains from the limbs
of her child!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when the mother and son were free,
they pledged themselves to the owner of another
plantation, to pay another thousand for the
wife and child of the ransomed son. The master
allowed the woman to come to the city,
and live with her husband, and work on her
own hook&mdash;paying him so much per month.
Three hundred dollars has been paid. Some
time in April, this oppressed class had a public
tea-party and fair, to gather funds to furnish
their church, a neat edifice on &mdash;&mdash; St.
The mother, son, and wife were there, returned
home, or started home, about midnight&mdash;the
horses ran away, and George, attempting to
get off the carriage to assist the driver, fell, and
his head was dashed to pieces against the corner
of a curb-stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died instantly, and the morning papers
announced the fact, and spoke of him as &ldquo;highly
worthy and respectable, and a member of
---- Church.&rdquo; But no sooner had the owner
of Susan, the wife, heard of George&rsquo;s death,
than he hurried to the city post-haste, and took
the afflicted wife from their house, drove her to
the Slave auction, and sold her to southern
traders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus were the three hundred dollars lost to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
those who earned it, the old, toiling mother
left childless; and the young wife, but yesterday
rejoicing in the strength and hope of
freedom and love, suddenly turned into a chattel,
and sold &ldquo;away down South,&rdquo; to be a beast of
burden&mdash;perhaps for a Legree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did it happen inquired Mrs. Gage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here, lately. I met the old mother
as I came from the &ldquo;Fourth&rdquo; Pic nic. She was
dressed in deep mourning. I had not seen her
for a long time, for they had got them a home,
and she did not wash any more. I asked her
what had happened, and she told me all. O!
Mrs. G., how it made me feel! I celebrating
our liberty, she, a woman&mdash;a wife&mdash;a mother
mourning over enslaved and doubly-wronged
children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;I know there is a God, Mrs. Lilly,&rdquo; the poor
bowed creature said to me, &ldquo;I know there is a
good God, and a Jesus, or I should give up in
despair, and sometimes I do; I look up and
down and all round, and <i>there is no light</i>!&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Slavery leaves its victims a prey to unchecked
avarice.</i> What protection has a slave against
the avarice of his master? Let us see. A law
of South Carolina provides that slaves shall
&ldquo;not labor to exceed <i>fifteen hours</i>&rdquo; out of twenty
four. This is called protection!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The slave is driven to the field in the morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>ing
about four o&rsquo;clock. The general calculation
is to get them to work by day-light. The
time for breakfast is between nine and ten
o&rsquo;clock. This meal is sometimes eaten &lsquo;bite
and work,&rsquo; others allow fifteen minutes, and
this is the only rest the slave has while in the
field.&rdquo; (<i>G. W. Westgate.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In North Carolina, the legal standard of
food for a slave must not be less than a <i>quart
of corn per day</i>. In Louisiana the legal standard
is one barrel of Indian corn&mdash;or the equivalent
thereof in rice, beans or other grain, and
a pint of salt, every month.&rdquo; &ldquo;The quantity
allowed by custom,&rdquo; said T. S. Clay of Georgia,
&ldquo;is a peck of corn per week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they return to their miserable huts at
night, they find not there the means of comfortable
rest, but on the cold ground they must lie,
without covering, and shiver while they slumber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clothing of slaves by day, and their
covering by night, are inadequate either for
comfort or decency, in any or most of the slaveholding
States.&rdquo; (<i>Elliott.</i>)</p>

<p>It is notorious that slaves, on large plantations
especially, are miserably fed, clothed and
lodged, and during busy seasons of the year,
most unmercifully worked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Slavery abandons its victims to unbridled
lust.</i> Against a master&rsquo;s lusts a slave has no
protection. It is an established principle of
the slave code that the <i>testimony</i> of a slave
against a white person cannot be received in a
court of justice. A slave woman who may be
abused cannot resort to the law. To whom
can she appeal? To God only. The master
may torture her in any way, so that he take
not her life, in order to <i>force</i> a compliance with
his base designs!</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very beautiful girl belonging to the estate
of John French, a deceased gambler of New
Orleans, was sold a few days since, for the
round sum of <i>seven thousand dollars</i>! An ugly
old bachelor, named Gouch, was the purchaser.
The <i>Picayune</i> says that she was remarkable
for her beauty and intelligence; and that there
was considerable strife as to who should be the
purchaser.&rdquo; (<i>Elliott.</i>)</p>

<p>Any one can understand why that beautiful,
intelligent slave girl brought <span class="small">SEVEN THOUSAND
DOLLARS</span>! She was bought for a sacrifice to
lust! And the law gave her no protection. It
required her to submit unresistingly to the will
of her owner and that owner was a base libertine!</p>

<p>7. <i>Slavery exposes its victims to the fury of
unrestrained passion.</i> A master in a violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
passion may fall upon his slave, and beat him
unmercifully without the slightest provocation
and <i>the slave has no redress</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The master is not liable for an assault and
battery committed upon the person of his
slave.&rdquo; (<i>Wheeler.</i>)</p>

<p>A Methodist minister, Rev. J. Boucher, relates
the following incident:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While on the Alabama circuit I spent the
Sabbath with an old circuit preacher, who was
also a doctor, living near &lsquo;the horse shoe,&rsquo; celebrated
as Gen. Jackson&rsquo;s battle ground. On
Monday morning early, he was reading Pope&rsquo;s
Messiah to me, when his wife called him out.
I glanced my eye out of the window, and saw
a slave man standing by, and they consulting
over him. Presently the doctor took a rawhide
from under his coat, and began to cut up
the half-naked back of the slave. I saw six or
seven inches of the skin turn up perfectly white
at every stroke, till the whole back was red
with gore. The lacerated man cried out some
at first; but at every blow the doctor cried,
&lsquo;won&rsquo;t ye hush? won&rsquo;t ye hush?&rsquo; till the slave
finally stood still and groaned. As soon as he had
done, the doctor came in panting, almost out
of breath, and, addressing me, said, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you
go to prayer with us, sir?&rsquo; I fell on my knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and prayed, but what I said I knew not. When
I came out the poor creature had crept up and
knelt by the door during prayer; and his back
was a gore of blood quite to his heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this slave could not appeal to the law
for redress or protection; and the same cruel
beating might have been repeated every week
until death had come to his relief, and the poor
wretch must only bear it&mdash;that is all. He was
wholly at the mercy of the passions of his master.</p>

<p>8. <i>Slavery subjects its victims to uncontrolled
and irresponsible tyranny.</i> Irresponsible power
cannot be safely entrusted with the wisest and
most humane persons. It is always liable to
great abuses. But when all sorts of men are
invested with it, when it can be purchased with
money, terrible beyond conception are its results.
Woe to the unhappy man who is put
absolutely into the power of a hard hearted
villain. But slaves are property and are exposed
to the irresponsible power of their masters.</p>

<p>A master or overseer may, with impunity
inflict upon a slave, without the slightest provocation,
any kind of torture, which can be endured,
and impose upon him all kinds of sufferings,
hardships and insults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>He may clothe him in rags, feed him upon
corn, lodge him in a mere pen of poles, work
him beyond his ability, kick him, cuff him,
knock him down, put him in stocks, strip him,
tie him to a stake, and with a keen lash lay on
his bare back until the blood runs in a
stream to his heels. The laws not only allow
this to be done, but it is done continually. <i>Women</i>,
yes, tender, delicate women; daughters,
sisters and mothers are unprotected by the laws.
They may be, and are tied to the whipping
post; every day that we live, this <i>is</i> done, and
their quivering flesh mangled by the cow-skin.</p>

<p>Dr. Howe visited a prison in New Orleans, in
which fugitive slaves are confined, and to which
many slaves are brought by their masters to be
whipped, for which punishment a small fee is
paid. In a letter to Hon. Charles Sumner, he
says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entering a large paved court-yard, around
which ran galleries filled with slaves of all
ages, sexes and colors, I heard the snap of a
whip, every stroke of which sounded like the
sharp crack of a pistol. I turned my head,
and beheld a sight which absolutely chilled me
to the marrow of my bones, and gave me, for
the first time in my life, the sensation of my
hair stiffening at the roots. There lay a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
girl flat upon her face, on a board, her two
thumbs tied, and fastened to one end, her feet
tied, and drawn tightly to the other end, while
a strap passed over the small of her back, and,
fastened around the board, compressed her closely
to it. Below the strap she was entirely naked.
By her side, and six feet off, stood a huge monster
with a long whip, which he applied with
dreadful power and wonderful precision. Every
stroke brought away a strip of skin, which
clung to the lash, or fell quivering on the pavement,
while the blood followed after it. The
poor creature writhed and shrieked, and in a
voice which showed alike her fear of death and
her dreadful agony, screamed to her master,
who stood at her head, &lsquo;O, spare my life! don&rsquo;t
cut my soul out!&rsquo; But still fell the horrid lash;
still strip after strip peeled off from the skin;
gash after gash was cut in her living flesh, until
it became a livid and bloody mass of raw
and quivering muscle. It was with the greatest
difficulty I refrained from springing upon
the torturer, and arresting his lash; but, alas!
what could I do, but turn aside and hide my
tears for the sufferer, and my blushes for humanity?
This was in a public and regularly-organized
prison; the punishment was one recognized
and authorized by the law. But
think you that the poor wretch had committed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
heinous offense, and had been convicted thereof
and sentenced to the lash? Not at all. She
was brought by her master to be whipped by
the common executioner, without trial, judge
or jury, just at his beck or nod, for some real or
supposed offense, or to gratify his own whim or
malice. And he may bring her day after day,
without cause assigned, and inflict any number
of lashes he pleases, short of twenty-five, provided
only he pays the fee. Or, if he choose,
he may have a private whipping board on his
own premises, and brutalize himself there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this is done according to law. &ldquo;We cannot
allow,&rdquo; said Judge Ruffin, &ldquo;the right of the
master to be brought into discussion in the
courts of justice. The slave, to remain a slave,
must be made sensible that there is <span class="small">NO APPEAL
FROM HIS MASTER</span>.&rdquo; The same Judge decided&mdash;that
&ldquo;<span class="small">THE POWER OF THE MASTER MUST BE ABSOLUTE
IN ORDER TO RENDER THE SUBMISSION OF THE SLAVE
PERFECT</span>.&rdquo; How dreadful is this tyranny!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
Slavery Illustrated&mdash;Continued.<br />
<span class="smaller">SEVERITY OF THE LAWS AGAINST SLAVES.</span></h2>

<p>As the laws provide for the degradation of
the slave to a state of the most stupid ignorance,
it would naturally be supposed that little
would be required in the way of obedience,
and that when a slave did trespass a very light
punishment would be meted out to him. Evidently
this would be the humane and just
course, for where little is given little should be
required. In this, however, as in most other
things slavery is precisely contrary to nature,
humanity and reason.</p>

<p>Slaves are punished by the laws for numerous
acts which are in themselves perfectly right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For seeking liberty a slave is proclaimed an
outlaw and may be lawfully killed.&rdquo; (<i>Goodell.</i>)
&ldquo;He may be punished for attending religious
meetings at night. He may be publicly whipped
for keeping a gun, or a pistol. For visiting
a wife or child without a written pass, he
may be whipped. For striking a white person,
no matter how great the provocation, whipping&mdash;and
for the second or third offence,
<span class="small">DEATH</span>.&rdquo; (<i>Goodell.</i>) These are but specimens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the cruel and vexatious laws by which the
slave&rsquo;s life is embittered. He, poor wretch,
must have so many lashes on the bare back
for almost every thing which his manhood
prompts him to do. He must always be on
the look out to act and feel as a mere brute&mdash;he
must crouch and bend in constant abjectness
or his back shall pay the penalty. But
for <i>actual crimes</i> the disproportion between the
punishment of slaves and white persons is very
great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Va., by the revised code of 1819, there are
seventy-one offenses for which the penalty is
death when committed by slaves and imprisonment
when committed by the whites.&rdquo; (<i>Jay&rsquo;s
Inquiry.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Mississippi there are seventeen offenses
punishable with death when committed by
slaves, which, if committed by white persons,
are either punished by fines or imprisonment,
or punishment not provided for by the statute
or at common law.&rdquo; (<i>Goodell.</i>)</p>

<p>A law of Md., provides that&mdash;&ldquo;Any slave for
rambling in the night, or riding on horseback
or running away, may be punished by whipping,
cropping and branding in the cheeks or otherwise,
not rendering him unfit for labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding the extreme and
unreasonable partiality and severity of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
laws, it is not unusual for the barbarous spirit
of slavery to overleap them in its unmerciful
punishment of the slave. When the slave commits
a high crime, not unfrequently does a furious
mob seize him, and hang him up without
trial as if he were a mean dog. Calmness and
solemnity, which should always characterize the
punishment of the <i>greatest</i> criminals in christian
countries, give place to the most violent
and cruel passions. Judgment, mercy, law,
humanity, God and Christianity, are all forgotten
in the hasty and insane desire to have the
wretched bondman pushed out of the world.
And perhaps the crime which has so violently
stirred up the community against him was committed
under the greatest provocations. His
soul may have been writhing under a crushing
sense of repeated wrongs. His wife may have
been abused before his eyes while he was not
permitted to defend her. His daughter may
have been dishonored, and he, without appeal
for her protection to church or State, compelled
to suffer it in silence. And his own back may
have been smarting from the maddening lash&mdash;and
in a moment of frenzy or despair he may
have smitten his oppressor to the earth.</p>

<p>And, for this crime he is treated as a prince
of criminals, is hung up without trial, or perhaps
<i>burned alive</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Our souls have been harrowed up by a circumstance
which transpired during the present
year (1853) in the State of Mo. Two negro
men for the commission of murder were arrested
and tied to a tree, near the county seat of
Jasper co., a fire was kindled around them, and
in the presence of two thousand persons, they
were burned to death! No time for reflection
or repentance was allowed. Not a word of
warning or exhortation was permitted. Even
a humane mode of being killed was denied.
But they were, in this year, during the Presidency
of <i>Pierce</i>, in the State of Missouri, <i>burned
without trial</i>!</p>

<p>In 1842 a negro was burned at Union Point,
Mississippi. The <i>Natchez Free Trader</i> gives
the following account of the horrible work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The body was taken and chained to a tree
immediately on the bank of the Mississippi, on
what is called Union Point. Fagots were then
collected, and piled around him to which he
appeared quite indifferent. When the work
was completed, he was asked what he had to
say. He then warned all to take example by
him, and asked the prayers of all around; he
then called for a drink of water, which was
handed to him; he drank it, and said, &lsquo;Now set
fire&mdash;I am ready to go in peace!&rsquo; The torches
were lighted and placed in the pile, which soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
ignited. He watched unmoved the curling
flame, that grew until it began to entwine itself
around and feed upon his body: then he
sent forth cries of agony painful to the ear,
begging some one to blow his brains out; at
the same time surging with almost superhuman
strength, until the staple with which the
chain was fastened to the tree (not being well
secured) drew out, and he leaped from the burning
pile. At that moment the sharp ringing of
several rifles was heard: the body of the negro
fell a corpse on the ground. He was picked
up by some two or three, and again thrown
into the fire and consumed&mdash;not a vestige remaining
to show that such a being ever existed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A colored man was burned in St. Louis, Mo.,
in 1836, in presence of an immense throng of
spectators. The <i>Alton Telegraph</i> gives the following
description of the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All was silent as death while the executioners
were piling wood around their victim. He
said not a word, until feeling that the flames
had seized upon him. He then uttered an awful
howl, attempting to sing and pray, then
hung his head, and suffered in silence, except
in the following instance: After the flames had
surrounded their prey, his eyes burnt out of his
head, and his mouth seemingly parched to a
cinder, some one in the crowd, more com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>passionate
than the rest, proposed to put an
end to his misery by shooting him, when it was
replied, &ldquo;that would be of no use, since he was
already out of pain.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the
wretch, &ldquo;I am not. I am suffering as much as
ever; shoot me, shoot me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said one
of the fiends, who was standing about the sacrifice
they were roasting, &ldquo;he shall not be shot.
<i>I would sooner slacken the fire, if that would increase
his misery.</i>&rdquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It may be said that we have in these illustrations
of slavery, exaggerated. But this can
not be the case, for we have given the laws and
the practice together, and have furnished the
testimony of eye-witnesses. And we could
bring forward a thousand witnesses from the
midst of slavery, whose testimony would confirm
all we have said. Yea more; they would
declare that half the extent of the evils of this
horrible institution are unknown. Hear if you
please, a voice from North Carolina&mdash;Mr.
Swain:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let any man of spirit and feeling for a moment
cast his thoughts over this land of slavery&mdash;think
of the nakedness of some, the hungry
yearnings of others, the flowing tears and heaving
sighs of parting relations, the wailings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<i>woe</i>, the bloody cut of the keen lash, and the
<i>frightful scream</i> that rends the very skies&mdash;and
all this to gratify ambition, lust, pride, avarice,
vanity, and other depraved feelings of the human
heart. <span class="smcap">The worst is not generally known.</span>
Were all the miseries, the horrors of slavery, to
burst at once into view, a peal of seven fold
thunder could scarce strike greater alarm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hear the venerable John Rankin, a native
and long resident of Tennessee. (<i>See Elliot
pp. 225.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many poor slaves are stripped naked, stretched
and tied across barrels, or large bags, <i>and
tortured with the lash during hours, and even whole
days, till their flesh is mangled to the very bones</i>.
Others are stripped and hung up by the arms,
their feet are tied together, and the end of a
heavy piece of timber is put between their legs
in order to stretch their bodies, and so prepare
them for the torturing lash&mdash;and in this situation
they are often whipped till their bodies are
covered <i>with blood and mangled flesh</i>&mdash;and, in order
to add the greatest keenness to their sufferings,
their wounds are washed with <i>liquid salt</i>!
And some of the miserable creatures are permitted
to hang in that position till they actually
<i>expire</i>; some die under the lash, others linger
about for a time, and at length die of their
wounds, and many survive, and endure again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
similar torture. These bloody scenes are <i>constantly
exhibiting in every slaveholding country&mdash;thousands
of whips are every day stained in African
blood</i>! Even the poor <i>females</i> are not permitted
to escape these shocking cruelties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And finally listen dispassionately to the <i>Presbyterian
Synod of Kentucky</i>, composed of those
whose interest it was to present slavery in as
favorable a light as possible. (<i>See Elliot pp.
225.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This system licenses and produces <i>great
cruelty</i>. Mangling, imprisonment, starvation,
every species of torture, may be inflicted upon
him, [the slave,] and he has no redress. There
are now in our whole land two millions of human
beings, exposed, defenseless, to every insult,
and every injury short of maiming or death,
which their fellow-men may choose to inflict.
They suffer all that can be inflicted by wanton
caprice, by grasping avarice, by brutal lust, by
malignant spite, and by insane anger. Their
happiness is the sport of every whim, and the
prey of every passion that may, occasionally
or habitually, infest the master&rsquo;s bosom. If
we could calculate the amount of woe endured
by ill-treated slaves, it would overwhelm every
compassionate heart&mdash;it would move even the
obdurate to sympathy. There is also a vast
sum of suffering inflicted upon the slave by hu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>mane
masters, as a punishment for that idleness
and misconduct which slavery naturally
produces. <span class="smcap">Brutal stripes</span> and all the varied
kinds of personal indignities, are not the only
species of cruelty which slavery licenses.&rdquo;</p>

Slavery and Religion.<br />
<span class="smaller">&ldquo;CURSED BE CANAAN.&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>Many slaveholders and their apologists have
sought to find authority for the &ldquo;enormity and
crime&rdquo; of slavery, in the Holy Bible. And we
are not surprised that the vile oppressor, smarting
under the lashings of a guilty conscience,
and condemned by the united voice of reason
and humanity, should fly for refuge from public
scorn and condemnation, to a shelter, however
insecure, erected by a perversion of the
writings and example of those remarkable men,
who fill a prominent place in sacred history.
How consoling it must be to the slaveholder,
while standing upon the neck of an unresisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
brother, and crushing his humanity into the dust
with heartless cruelty, to hear from a doctor of
divinity that Noah countenanced the enslavement
of a part of his posterity, that Abraham
was an extensive slaveholder, that Moses incorporated
the system into the only government
ever instituted by direct authority from Heaven,
and that it received, in its very worst form, under
the Roman government, the tacit, if not
positive sanction of Jesus and the apostles.</p>

<p>My observation sustains me in saying that
no class of slaveholders are more pertinacious
and incorrigible than the religious class&mdash;the
scripture-quoting class. If we are to believe
them, slaveholding is not a sin <span class="small">PER SE</span>, but of
itself is a perfectly innocent thing. The very
best of men hold slaves, yea, it is, they tell us,
the duty of good men under some circumstances
to hold slaves. To be sure <span class="small">THEY</span> do not
hold slaves for &ldquo;gain,&rdquo; but from motives of
pure &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; or from stern &ldquo;necessity.&rdquo;
<i>They</i> and <i>their</i> slaves are <span class="small">ALWAYS</span> in such peculiar
cases that emancipation would be impolitic,
impracticable, even a sin! Still, from all
appearances, they are as careful to keep their
slaves from running off as common sinners are&mdash;their
slaves are fed, clothed, whipped, worked,
robbed and used up precisely as are the slaves
of the most notorious publicans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>After having seen how slavery originated,
and what it is in theory and practice, it may
seem useless if not impious to inquire seriously
whether a system so manifestly unjust, cruel
and diabolical, is sanctioned in the Bible; but
the confidence with which slaveholders and
their apologists quote it in defense of slavery,
and the recklessness with which it is denounced
by a class of infidel abolitionists, impel us to
enter into this inquiry; and in pursuing it we
shall endeavor to examine carefully all the arguments
relied upon by the advocates of human
bondage. The first passage in order is found
in Genesis 9: 25. &ldquo;And he said, cursed be Canaan,
a servant of servants shall he be to his
brethren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is assumed that this curse was pronounced
by divine authority; that the servitude here
mentioned is identical with slavery; that the
prediction of the oppression of a people justifies
their oppressors; and finally, that American
slaves are the identical posterity of Canaan.</p>

<p>1. As it respects the authority of this curse,
there is a circumstance intimately associated
with its utterance which excites a shadow of
doubt with regard to its inspiration. &ldquo;And
Noah awoke from his wine&rdquo; and pronounced
this malediction. Is it not possible that these
words were the hasty expression of excited feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ing
and not the solemn enunciation of a divine
anathema?</p>

<p>2. But in order to prove the validity of the argument,
it must be proved that servitude and
slavery are relations of essentially the same
character, and this cannot be done. Neither
philology nor history affords the slightest proof
of the assumption that to be a servant of servants
is equivalent to being a <i>slave of slaves</i>.</p>

<p>3. But does the prediction of the oppression
of a people justify that oppression? Verily it
does not. The Lord said unto Abraham that
his seed should be afflicted in a strange land
four hundred years. But who will pretend to
justify the Egyptian task-masters on the plea
that the affliction of Israel had been predicted?
The divine prescience sees all things at one
glance, and may inspire men to prophesy, but
prophecy touches not the moral agency of men.
When our Lord was crucified, the &ldquo;scripture
was fulfilled,&rdquo; but they who crucified him were
murderers, nevertheless. Hence, even should
we admit that the curse pronounced on Canaan
was of divine authority, and that it meant
slavery, no stronger apology for slaveholding
could be derived therefrom than Egyptian oppressors
might have drawn from the words of
Jehovah, for the affliction of Israel in Egypt
four hundred years. The cases are parallel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>4. But the argument is utterly baseless because
American slaves are not the posterity of
Canaan, upon whom the curse was pronounced,
and hence that anathema affords just as
good an apology for the enslavement of Englishmen
as colored Americans. Ham had
four sons,&mdash;Cush, Misriam, Phut, and Canaan,
and the curse was directed against <i>Canaan</i> or
Canaan&rsquo;s posterity. But, says one, are not the
negroes children of Canaan? By no means.
No scholar has ever pretended that Canaan
was the progenitor of the negro race.</p>

<p>The sacred penman is very careful to put
this matter <i>beyond dispute</i>. He says: &ldquo;And
Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,
and the Jubisite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the
Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and
the Hamathite; and afterward were the families
of the Canaanites spread abroad. And
the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon,
as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou
goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah
and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.&rdquo; Gen. 10: 15-19.
Now these nations and boundaries were all located
in Asia, and we have no evidence of the
subsequent removal of any of the posterity of
Canaan to Africa except it be the founders of
Carthage,&mdash;a city which was long mistress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the sea, and the proud rival of imperial Rome.
The Carthaginians were supposed to be the descendants
of Canaan.</p>

<p>This curse, therefore, did not allude to slavery,
but servitude; and as it is a mere prediction
of what would be the relation of Canaan&rsquo;s
posterity it afforded no apology for the oppression
of that posterity;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and finally the Africans
and colored Americans <i>are not the descendants
of Canaan</i>, and hence, the passage can
have no application to them; and affords <i>just
as good authority</i> for the enslavement of Englishmen,
Dutchmen and Frenchmen as negroes.</p>

<p>How absurd is the attempt to take this anathema,
construe it to <i>mean</i> and <i>justify</i> chattel
slavery, and then <i>stretch</i> it over the posterity,
not of Canaan, but of Cush even after the blood
of the Cushites (Moses&rsquo; wife was a Cushite)
has been mingled with the blood of the &ldquo;first
families&rdquo; of Virginia, and of all the Southern
states. A large number of slaves are white&mdash;much
whiter than their masters and mistresses.
The first Bible argument for slavery appears,
when weighed,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Light as a puff of empty air.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Have slaveholders no better? We will see.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
Slavery and Religion&mdash;Continued.<br />
<span class="smaller">PATRIARCHAL SERVITUDE AND SLAVERY.</span></h2>

<p>The next Bible argument for slavery, usually
adduced, is founded upon the assumption that
the patriarchs were slaveholders, and particular
stress is placed upon the example of Abraham,
&ldquo;the friend of God,&rdquo; who, it is confidently
asserted, was an extensive slaveholder.</p>

<p>The Harmony Presbytery, South Carolina,
&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, that slavery has existed from the
days of those good old <i>slaveholders</i> and patriarchs,
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Presbytery of Tombecbee said: &ldquo;In the
Bible the state of slavery is clearly recognized.
Abraham the friend of God had slaves born in
his house and bought with his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Fuller, in his controversy with Dr. Wayland,
assumed that father Abraham was a slaveholder,
and that his example was a sufficient
warrant for slaveholding in all ages. The same
position was taken by Dr. Rice in his debate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
with Mr. Blanchard. Mr. Fletcher, author of
a late voluminous defense of slavery, takes the
same position.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that in this argument two
things are assumed. 1st That the patriarchs
did hold slaves. 2d That the example of a
patriarch is conclusive evidence in the case.
If it should appear after an examination of the
case, that none of the patriarchs owned slaves, or
that the example of a patriarch is not conclusive
evidence on all moral questions, and may
not, in every case, be safely followed, then this
argument will also be found wanting.</p>

<p>Now, I assume the position that neither Abraham,
nor any other patriarch, ever owned a
slave; and as evidence in support of this position
submit the following facts and considerations.</p>

<p>1. The Bible does not record such a fact.
In no chapter or verse is Abraham, Isaac or Jacob
called a slaveholder, slave-driver, slave-trader,
or by any other name indicative of such
a relation. Nor is any man, or woman in their
employ, either in the house or field, or in any
way associated with them, called a slave or by
any name indicative of that relation.</p>

<p>2. The Bible records in connection with the
history of the patriarchs, no circumstance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
which slaveholding may be legitimately inferred.
Those inseparable concomitants of slavery,
the <i>whip</i>, <i>coffle</i>, <i>chain-gang</i>, <i>whipping-post</i> and
<i>overseer</i>, are not named in patriarchal history.</p>

<p>3. Some circumstances are recorded from
which we obtain presumptive evidence that they
did not own slaves. Take for example, an incident
in the life of Abraham. He was sitting
in his tent door in the cool of the day and saw
at a little distance three strangers whom he
immediately approached and invited, in the
spirit of genuine hospitality, to tarry with him
and partake of some refreshments. When he
had obtained their consent, he hastened unto
the tent to Sarah and requested her to bake
some cakes with all possible dispatch, while he
should run to the herd and fetch a calf tender
and good and have it dressed. The repast was
soon provided, the guests were seated around
the wholesome meal, and Abraham stood by
them under the tree while they ate. Now, I
submit, had this patriarch been a slaveholder,
he would have ordered &ldquo;Cuffee&rdquo; to the flock
after the calf, and had Sarah been a mistress
of slaves she would have ordered &ldquo;Dinah&rdquo; to
the kneading trough. In this incident there is
no mention of slaves. A &ldquo;young <i>man</i>&rdquo; is respectfully
noticed without the slightest hint that
he was a slave. Abraham and Sarah went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
about preparing this entertainment precisely as
good people do, who attend to their own work,
and have no slaves to order around.</p>

<p>4. We have good reasons for believing that
chattel slavery had no existence in the world
at the time the patriarchs referred to, flourished.
Abraham was born only two years after
the death of Noah, and when as yet the postdiluvian
world was in its infancy, and it is not
probable, leaving history out of view, that
slavery could have been instituted at so early
a period. But the most ancient and reliable
history furnishes evidence that for a period after
the flood, reaching down far this side the
patriarchal age, universal freedom was preserved.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On the authority of <i>Diodorus</i>, Shuckford says,
that &ldquo;the nations planted by Noah and his descendants,
<i>had a law against slavery; for no person
among them could absolutely lose his freedom
and become a bondsman</i>.&rdquo; (<i>Shuckford&rsquo;s Connections,
Vol. II, pp. 80.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Athenaus, a Greek historian of great merit,
observes that the Babylonians, Persians, as well
as the Greeks, and divers other nations, celebrated
annually a sort of Saturnalia, or feast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
instituted most probably <span class="smcap">in commemoration of
the original state of freedom, in which men lived
before servitude was introduced; and as Moses
revived several of Noah&rsquo;s institutions</span>, so there
are appointments in the law to preserve the
freedom of the Israelites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From these authorities to which others might
be added, we conclude that slavery had no existence
among the nations which arose immediately
after the flood. Noah, it seems was a
good democrat, and gave existence to institutions
which secured the personal freedom of his
descendants; and absolutely prohibited their enslavement.
And it also appears that those institutions
were for a long period observed, and
finally incorporated by Moses into the Law for
the preservation of the liberties of the Israelites.
Now, Abraham was contemporary with
the sons of Noah, and was a governor of one
of the very earliest nations alluded to by the
historians above quoted; hence it is clear,
that slavery had no existence in his day, and
consequently he could not have been a slaveholder.</p>

<p>Against this view it may be urged that slavery
existed in Egypt in the time of Joseph, that
Joseph was sold as a slave, and that the Israelites
were slaves when in Egypt. To this objection
we answer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The assumption that slavery existed in
Egypt in the time of the patriarchs is without
foundation. <i>Herodotus</i>, gives a &ldquo;true and full&rdquo;
account of the ancient Egyptians, specifies
with great care the various classes of men, but
does not mention slaves. <i>Diodorus</i>, gives a
careful statement of the ancient Egyptian constitution,
but is silent respecting slavery.</p>

<p><i>Rollin</i> says: &ldquo;Husbandmen, shepherds, and
artificers formed the three lower classes of lower
life in Egypt, but were nevertheless had in <i>very
great esteem</i>, particularly husbandmen and shepherds.&rdquo;
We have the best of reasons, therefore,
for believing that the wholesome institutions
of Noah were preserved for a long time in
Egypt. That a system of servitude existed in
that country is true, but absolute slavery was
not permitted. Parents possessed great authority
over their children, and might sell them
or their services, for a limited time, but this was
not slavery. A year of release was provided
for all, so that no one could, as Diodorus observes,
&ldquo;absolutely lose his freedom and become
a bondsman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. Joseph was not a slave. He was doubtless
sold as a servant for a limited period, and
evidently that period had expired before he
arose to the high station of Steward of Potipher&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The Israelites were not slaves in Egypt.
They maintained their nationality, preserved
their family relations, owned property, and
were not distributed throughout the country,
as chattel slaves are. Their servitude was
national. Their task masters were appointed
by the government, and they labored for the
public benefit. They were not domestic slaves.</p>

<p>The position I think is invulnerable, that in
the nations which arose and peopled the earth,
immediately after the flood, slavery had no existence;
and as the patriarchs flourished in that
period, the inference is clear that they did not
own slaves, and were not slaveholders. Those
holy men would hardly be the first to violate
the free institutions of Noah, and disgrace the
golden age of freedom, by the enslavement of
their brothers.</p>

<p>But it is asserted with a show of confidence
that the word servant, as applied in the scriptures
to a class of persons, means precisely
what our word slave means. Hence, when it
is said that Abraham had <i>servants</i>, it is assumed
that he had <span class="small">SLAVES</span>. Now, although what
has been proved, is altogether sufficient to exculpate
that good man and all the patriarchs
from the charge of slaveholding, we deem it
important that the word translated servant be
well understood; and with the aid of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
authorities we shall now proceed to make it
plain.</p>

<p>The Hebrew words translated servant, service,
and servants, are derived from <i>abadh</i>,
meaning to labor, <i>to work</i>, to do work. This
word occurs in the Hebrew scriptures some
hundreds of times, in various forms of the word,
and is never rendered <i>slaves</i>. Occasionally,
our translators have prefixed the word <i>bond</i>,
and made it read <i>bond</i>-servant, but this was
done without authority, as precisely the same
word is used in the original. The original word
is used to denote the following kinds of service:
To work for another; Gen. 29: 20. To serve
or be servants of a king; 2d Sam., 16: 19. To
serve as a soldier; 2d Sam., 2: 12, 13, 15, 30, 31.
To serve as an ambassador; 2d Sam., 10: 2, 4.
It is applied to a worshipper of the true God;
Nehemiah, 1: 10. To a minister; Isaiah, 49: 6.
It is also applied to king Rehoboam; 1st Kings,
11: 7, and to the Messiah, Isaiah, 42: 1.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It is used in Gen. 2: 15. And the Lord God
took the man, and put him in the garden of
Eden to <span class="small">DRESS IT</span>. Adam was put into Eden,
not to <i>serve</i> or <i>dress</i> the garden as a <span class="small">SLAVE</span>, but
as a man. The same word is used to express
the service performed for Laban by Jacob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
The relation of Joshua to Moses is expressed
by the same word; Ex., 33: 21. It is also used
in the fourth commandment. Six days shalt
thou <i>labor</i>, etc.</p>

<p>From these examples of the use of the word
it is clear that the idea of chattel slavery is not
found in it. It is used to express all kinds of
service&mdash;the service of God, a king, a friend,
or an employer.</p>

<p>The word <i>ama</i>, rendered <i>maid-servant</i>, <i>bond-maid</i>,
<i>maid</i>, <i>hand-maid</i>, and the word <i>shiphhah</i>
with similar renderings, are applied to Hagar,
Ruth, Hannah, Abigail, Bilhah and Zilpah,
and evidently mean no more than our English
word servant in its usual acceptation. Those
women were not slaves, they were free women.
It has been very properly remarked that if
<i>chattel</i> slavery existed among the Hebrews at
any time it is not a little surprising that the
language contains no word which expresses the
relation.</p>

<p>Some have endeavored to force into the word
translated <i>servant</i> &amp;c., the idea of slavery because
it is said that Abraham had servants
&ldquo;bought with money.&rdquo; But from the ancient
use of the word <i>buy</i> or <i>bought</i> we are not to infer
that the persons bought became slaves.
Wives were procured in the times of the patriarchs
by <i>purchase</i>. Boaz said&mdash;&ldquo;Moreover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have
I purchased to be my wife.&rdquo; The same word
(<i>kanithi</i>) is used here to express the manner in
which Boaz obtained his wife, that is used in
Gen. to show how a part of Abraham&rsquo;s servants
were obtained. But the beautiful <i>Ruth</i> was
not a <i>slave</i>. Jacob purchased his beloved Rachel,
and less beloved Leah, but those wives
and mothers of the twelve patriarchs could not
have been <i>slaves</i>. Had they been chattels,
why, then, according to an essential feature of
the American slave code, the twelve patriarchs
would all have been born in the same condition.
<i>Partus sequitur ventrem.</i> A Hebrew
might sell himself on a limited time, and he
might be bought by a wealthy neighbor, but no
one, I believe, has ever pretended that he became
a <span class="small">SLAVE</span> thereby. The contract was voluntary.
The employer bought the services of
his fellow, and paid in <i>advance</i> for the same,
not to a third person, but to the servant himself.
God is said to have purchased (<i>kanitha</i>)
his people; Ps., 75: 2.</p>

<p>Hence from the scriptural use of the word
buy, or bought, we are not authorized to infer
that the persons purchased became slaves.
Such an inference would do violence to the holy
word.</p>

<p>The true state of the matter in respect to Abra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>ham,
and his case is mainly relied upon, was
without a doubt this. Abraham, being a wise,
wealthy and good man, gathered around him
many devoted friends who, upon his removal
to a distant location, desired to accompany
him, to receive the benefits of his friendship
and counsels, live under his patriarchship, as he
was a prince, (see Gen., 23: 6,) and enjoy the
protection of his power. Some of these may
have been involved in pecuniary embarrassments
or obligations of service to other persons,
which made it necessary for the benevolent
patriarch to release them by paying them
in advance for many years of service.</p>

<p>Many of these servants were doubtless converts
from idolatry, which had been made in
Haran. In Gen. 12: 5, the fact is recorded of
the removal of Abraham, Sarai, their effects,
and of &ldquo;the <span class="small">SOULS</span> they had gotten.&rdquo; This word
&ldquo;gotten&rdquo; is translated, says Mr. Carothers,
from <i>osa</i>, which is used in Ezekiel 18: 31, to
express the work of conversion. &ldquo;Cast away
from you all your transgressions, and make
you a new heart and a new spirit.&rdquo; And this
rendering of the word &ldquo;gotten&rdquo; is confirmed
by the Chaldee paraphrase on this passage,
which reads thus: &ldquo;Souls they had instructed
or turned from idolatry and taught in the true
religion.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hebrews have a tradition,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
says Banberg, &ldquo;that Abraham brought over
many men, and Sarah many women from infidelity
to the knowledge and worship of the
true God; and thus <i>made</i> them spiritually.&rdquo; A
similar mode of expression is used by St. Paul:
&ldquo;I have <i>begotten</i> you through the gospel.&rdquo; The
idea that Abraham and Sarah made slaves of
their converts is simply preposterous.</p>

<p>From the foregoing facts and considerations
it is perfectly clear to my mind, that the effort
to find an apology for slaveholding in patriarchal
servitude is a total failure. The charge
that the patriarchs held slaves is <i>wholly</i> without
foundation,&mdash;is a disingenuous attack upon
their reputation, and a miserable subterfuge
for hard-hearted oppressors, who are seeking
an apology or excuse for sins which loudly cry
for the vengeance of heaven! Could Father
Abraham arise from the dead, visit the South,
and there behold thousands of his spiritual
children toiling without remuneration, shut out
from the blessings of family and home, denied
an education and all means of intellectual improvement,
driven by the keen lash of a brutal
overseer, and then should he hear an appeal
made to the patriarchs in justification of this
system of unmingled tyranny, he would indignantly
repel the appeal as a base calumny!</p>

<p>It is surprising with what confidence the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>ample
of the patriarchs is urged in justification
of slavery in the absence of all proof or
semblance of proof, that they were implicated
in this practice. But our surprise is increased
when we consider that, even could it be made
appear that the patriarchs did hold slaves, this
fact of itself, would afford not the slightest
apology for slaveholding now. The patriarchs,
it is admitted, had a plurality of wives, but
their example is not now a sufficient warrant
for polygamy. There is not an ecclesiastical
court in the United States and territories, if we
may except the Mormon, Utah, which would
accept the example of the patriarchs as an
apology for the man who should stand up before
that court with two wives leaning on his
arms. The argument therefore appears utterly
worthless and shallow from every point of
view.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
Slavery and Religion&mdash;Continued.<br />
<span class="smaller">LAW OF MOSES AND SLAVERY.</span></h2>

<p>It is claimed by the advocates of human bondage
that in the law delivered by Moses for the
government of the children of Israel, until the
establishment of the kingdom of Christ, slavery
is distinctly recognized, carefully regulated,
and unequivocally sanctioned; and hence, that
it is an institution upon which Jehovah now
looks with approbation. We cannot believe,
they argue, that it is wrong for christians to
practice what the law of Moses permitted or
sanctioned. To this argument we reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That many things were allowed by the
law of Moses which are strictly prohibited by
the law of Christ. That law was imperfect in
its character, limited in its application, and
temporary in its design. It contained a number
of statutes which could by no means be
incorporated into the laws of a christian state.</p>

<p>Among the things commanded and allowed
by the law under consideration, the following
may be specified:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It commanded a Hebrew, even though a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
married man, with wife and children living,
to take the childless widow of a deceased brother,
and beget children with her; Deut., 25: 5-10.</p>

<p>2. The Hebrews, under certain restrictions,
were allowed to make concubines, or wives for
a limited time, of women taken in war; Deut.
21: 10-14.</p>

<p>3. A Hebrew who already had a wife, was
allowed to take another also; provided he still
continued his intercourse with the first as her
husband, and treated her kindly and affectionately;
Exodus 21: 9-11.</p>

<p>4. By the Mosaic law, the nearest relative of
a murdered Hebrew could pursue and slay the
murderer, unless he could escape to the city of
refuge; and the same permission was given in
case of accidental homicide; Num. 35: 9-34.</p>

<p>5. The Israelites were commanded to exterminate
the Canaanites, men, women and children;
Deut. 9: 12; 20: 16-18.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each of these laws, although in its time it
was an ameliorating law, designed to take the
place of some barbarous abuse, and to be a
connecting link by which some higher state of
society might be introduced, belongs confessedly
to that system which St. Paul says made
nothing perfect. They are a part of the commandment
which he says was annulled for the
weakness and unprofitableness thereof, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
which, in the time which he wrote, was waxing
old, and ready to vanish away.&rdquo; (<i>Dr. Stowe.</i>)</p>

<p>Now, will any one pretend that it is proper
for a christian, having a wife, to take also the
wife of a deceased brother? But the law of
Moses authorized this as clearly as any one
pretends that it authorized slavery. Is it allowable
for a christian to take a concubine or
marry three or four wives? But the law of
Moses allowed this as distinctly as any one believes
that it allowed slavery. Would it be
right for a christian to pursue a neighbor who
had committed accidental or intentional homicide,
overtake and slay him? But the law of
Moses justified the Jewish man-slayer as plainly
as the most ultra defender of slavery maintains
that it justified slaveholding. Suppose
we admit, for argument sake, that slavery was
authorized by the law of Moses, does it follow
as a matter of course, that the law of Christ
authorizes it? By no means; for we have seen
that the former authorized concubinage, polygamy,
extermination of the heathen, and summary
vengeance upon the unwitting murderer,
all of which things are utterly incompatible
with the precepts of the latter. And slavery
might very properly be placed in the category
of those practices allowed by the law, but prohibited
by the gospel. Thus the argument for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
slavery from the law of Moses proves too much,
and therefore proves nothing.</p>

<p>2. But if, as is claimed, the Jews <i>were</i> authorized
to enslave their fellow men, which we by
no means admit, it was by express authority
from God, who alone may deprive any of his
creatures of the rights with which he has invested
them. Express grants <i>were</i> made to the
&ldquo;chosen seed,&rdquo; as for instance, the forcible occupancy
of the land of Canaan, and of the
cities thereof. Now those grants were not
made to Americans, but to the ancient Israelites,
and it is neither modest nor sensible for
citizens of the United States to act under a
charter which they admit was made to an ancient
nation, for a temporary purpose. Let
the American slaveholder show the same <i>authority</i>
for slaveholding which he maintains the
Jew could produce. Has God ever made a
grant to <i>Americans</i> to enslave the Africans?</p>

<p>3. Again, the passage mainly relied upon is
found in Leviticus, 25: 44-47; in which the
Jews are authorized to procure servants of the
<i>nations</i>, (not heathen, for <i>heathen</i> is not in the
original) round about them. Now if this celebrated
passage be at all to the purpose, it is,
as Pres. Edwards has said, &ldquo;a permission to every
nation under heaven to buy slaves of the nations
round about them; to us, to buy of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Indian neighbors; to them, to buy of us; to the
French to buy of the English, and to the English
to buy of the French; and so through the
world. Thus according to this construction,
we have here an institution of a universal slave
trade, by which every man may not only become
a merchant, but may rightfully become
the merchandize itself of this trade, and be
bought and sold like a beast.&rdquo; Who is willing
to admit the consequences of this construction?</p>

<p>We might here rest the case, because these
three considerations, taken separately, or together,
destroy entirely the whole force of the
argument for American slavery predicated
upon Levitical servitude.</p>

<p>We shall now inquire what kind of servitude
<i>was</i> recognized and regulated by the law of
Moses. The particular statute upon which the
main reliance is placed, by the friends of slavery,
and which is supposed to contain the black
and bloody <i>charter</i> for the degradation of humanity,
is found in Leviticus 25: 44-47, and
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids
which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen
that are round about you: of them shall ye buy
bondmen and bondmaids. Moreover of the
children of strangers that do sojourn among
you, of them shall ye buy, and of their fami<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>lies
that are with you, which they beget in
your land: and they shall be your possession.
And ye shall take them as an inheritance for
your children after you, to inherit them for a
possession, they shall be your bondmen forever.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>1. The word <i>slave</i>, it will be observed, does
not occur in this passage, nor does bondmen
and bondmaids mean anything more than men-servants
and women-servants. The word <i>bond</i>,
as we have seen, is gratuitously supplied by
our translators, and is not in the original; and
the word <i>servants</i> means no more than <i>laborers</i>
or <i>workers</i>. All kinds of servants are described
by the term here found, and hence from its
use in this place, it cannot be inferred that the
persons referred to were slaves. The passage
clearly authorized the procurement of servants
from adjoining nations, which was a thing perfectly
right in itself, and that is all it did authorize.</p>

<p>2. Nor does the fact that the passage allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ed
the <i>purchase</i> of servants, prove that the persons
purchased were slaves, or became slaves.
Irishmen were, many of them, a few years
since, &ldquo;bought servants.&rdquo; They were sold to
pay for their passage to this country, but the
whole transaction was voluntary on the part
of the &ldquo;sons of Erin,&rdquo; and looked to their benefit.
Jacob, as we have seen, purchased Leah
and Rachel with fourteen years of labor. Our
blessed Savior hath purchased us with his own
blood. The idea of chattel slavery cannot be
associated with the word buy or bought, as used
in the sacred writings, without doing great violence
to their meaning. The phrase, &ldquo;of them
shall ye <i>buy</i>&rdquo; may be properly rendered, &ldquo;of
them shall ye <i>get</i>, or <i>obtain</i> servants.&rdquo; The
word translated buy, in the passage before us,
is in other places translated &ldquo;get&rdquo; or &ldquo;getteth.&rdquo;
Thus, &ldquo;He that beareth reproof <i>getteth</i> understanding.&rdquo;
Prov., 15: 32. &ldquo;He that <i>getteth</i>
wisdom, loveth his own soul.&rdquo; Prov., 19: 8.
But the meaning of the word buy, and sell, as
applied to the purchase and sale of men, is
definitely settled by its use in the context of the
passage which we are examining. It is used in
verse 47, &ldquo;if thy brother wax poor and <i>sell himself</i>&rdquo;
etc. In verse 39, the reading is, &ldquo;and <i>be
sold</i>.&rdquo; These passages are intended to convey an
idea of the same transaction, and that transac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>tion
was nothing more nor less than the voluntary
sale of a poor man to a rich one, not as a
slave, but as a servant. The sale was made,
and the <i>money was received by the servant who
sold himself</i>, with which he released himself and
family from pecuniary embarrassment. In this
sale and purchase of a man, the idea of slavery
is utterly excluded. Now is it probable that
the words buy, and sell, in this same chapter,
when applied to foreign servants, were used in a
totally different sense? To suppose this would
be to charge Moses, as Wm. Jay observes, with
a fraudulent intent to render the meaning of
his law doubtful and unintelligible.</p>

<p>3. Considerable stress is placed upon the
phrase, &ldquo;shall be of the <i>heathen</i>,&rdquo; as if heathenism
was a crime to be punished with a still
deeper degradation than idolatry can produce.
&ldquo;The word heathen,&rdquo; says Mr. Jay, &ldquo;is gratuitously
inserted by our translators instead of
<i>nations</i>, the meaning of the original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. Permission was also given for the purchase
of the &ldquo;children of the strangers.&rdquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Children
of the strangers&rsquo; is an orientalism, for
strangers, as &lsquo;children of the East,&rsquo; &lsquo;children of
the Province,&rsquo; &lsquo;children of the Ethiopians.&rsquo;
Hence, the Jews, instead of buying little boys
and girls of their parents, were to buy foreigners
residing in the country; and not only for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>eigners,
but their descendants, natives of Palestine.&rdquo;
(<i>Jay.</i>)</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;They shall be your bondmen forever.&rdquo;
In this phrase is supposed to be found a charter
for perpetual, hereditary, hopeless bondage.
Mr. Jay very justly remarks upon it as follows:
&ldquo;The preconceived opinions of the translators
tempted them to give such a color to
this sentence as best accorded with their proslavery
theory. Hence this strong expression
in the text, while in the <i>margin</i> the <i>literal</i> translation
is honestly given, &ldquo;Ye shall serve yourselves
with them forever.&rdquo; Not a word about
bondmen, but merely an unlimited permission,
as to time, to use or employ foreigners or
strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proslavery construction renders the permission
absurd, because in the first place it
would be impossible for any one man literally
to be a bondman forever, unless servitude
could be continued in heaven or hell. And, in
the next place, it could not continue in the
same person in Israel beyond the great jubilee.</p>

<p>Now when this passage in Leviticus 25, is
stripped of all the proslavery glosses of the
translators, the following is, as the excellent
writer just quoted observes, its plain and obvious
meaning:&mdash;&ldquo;You may buy of themselves,
for servants, men and women who are natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of the adjoining countries, just as you have
already been authorized to buy your own countrymen
for servants. You may also buy, for
servants, strangers residing among you, and
their descendants; and your children after
you may do the same. You may always employ
them as servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servitude permitted by the law of Moses
has been most grossly misrepresented, and
misunderstood. It was not an institution looking
mainly to the advantage of the rich and
powerful, while it crushed the poor and defenseless
into the dust, disregarding their interests
and their sorrows, but it was a benificent arrangement
intended to relieve the unfortunate
and open a door of hope to the Gentile inquirer
of the way to Zion. Now observe carefully
the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Servants were not kidnapped or stolen
from the surrounding nations. The stealing
of a man was made a capital offense. He that
stealeth a man and (<i>or</i> it should be) selleth him,
or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely
be put to death. Ex. 21: 16. Now, as all
the slaves in America have been stolen, those
who stole them, and those who hold them, are
worthy of death according to the law of Moses.</p>

<p>2. All the servants obtained by the Jews from
neighboring nations were <i>voluntary</i> servants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
This is proved in the following way. 1. Foreign
servants, and native Hebrew servants were
obtained in the same manner. Native Hebrews
became servants (except in cases of
crime) by voluntary contract. 2. Obedience
to the law of Moses was a condition of servitude
in the Jewish state. An idolater was not
allowed to remain in the land. And a bought
servant was obliged to renounce idolatry, receive
the rite of circumcision, and in all things
conform to the law of Moses, as his master
was required to do. Gen. 17: 10-15. Ex. 23:
15-20. Deut. 16: 10-18. All were required
to enter into the most solemn religious covenant.
&ldquo;Ye stand this day, all of you, before
the Lord your God; your captains of your
tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all
the men of Israel, your little ones, your wives,
and thy stranger that is in thy camp, <i>from the
hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water</i>;
that <i>thou</i> shouldest enter into covenant with
the Lord thy God, and into his oath, which the
Lord thy God maketh with thee this day.&rdquo;
Deut. 29. But conformity to the law of Moses
was voluntary. We cannot conceive that
a Jew was allowed to buy a heathen servant
against his will, tie him, inflict upon him the
rite of circumcision, and then compel him to
observe the great feasts ordained by the law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and, otherwise conform to the Jewish religion.
Hence the acceptance of a place as a servant
in a Jewish family was a matter of choice.
3. Servants were not obliged to remain with
their masters. If they saw proper to change
their situation, they had a perfect right to do
so, just as laborers now have, and there was
no fugitive slave law to prevent them from so
doing. &ldquo;Thou shalt not deliver unto his master
the servant that is escaped unto thee. He
shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that
place he shall choose, in one of thy gates where
it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.&rdquo;
Deut. 23: 15, 16. From these facts, the conclusion
is irresistible that servitude was not
<i>forced</i> upon a foreigner, but voluntarily accepted
by him, and that his continuance in that relation
was voluntary. How great the contrast
between this system and American slavery
which utterly disregards the <i>will</i> of slaves.</p>

<p>3. Foreign servants were to be treated in all
respects precisely as native Hebrew servants
were to be treated. &ldquo;Ye shall have one manner
of law, as well for the stranger as for one
of your own country, for I am the Lord your
God.&rdquo; Lev. 24: 22.</p>

<p>4. Ample provisions were made for the religious
improvement of servants of all classes
and especially foreign servants. They were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
observe the sabbath, go up with their masters
to the three great annual feasts celebrated at
Jerusalem, listen to the reading of the law, and
in short enjoy all the advantages of the Jewish
religion. Mr. Barnes estimates that in a
period of fifty years, not less than twenty three
were appropriated to the exclusive benefit of servants,
during which time their whole attention
might be devoted to the interests of their souls.
Does not this indicate that the great design of
the employment of foreign servants was religious?
Is there the least similarity between
this system of servitude and American slavery?</p>

<p>5. Special provisions were made to secure
the kind treatment of all foreigners, foreign
servants of course included. &ldquo;Thou shalt not
vex a stranger nor oppress him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou shalt
not oppress a stranger, for ye know the heart
of a stranger.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cursed be he that perverteth
the judgment of the stranger.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord
your God regardeth not persons. Love ye
therefore the stranger.&rdquo; But does not American
slavery vex and oppress the stranger and
pervert his judgment? The wide world cannot
produce a class of persons who are, or ever
have been oppressed, if American slaves are
not. The word oppression is too feeble to express
the tyranny suffered by the strangers in
our land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Servants under the law of Moses could
not be sold. No permission was given for the
sale of servants. They could not be taken for
the payment of debts, or as pledges, or presents.
<i>They never were sold</i> or given away. The
reason of this is found in the fact that they
were not chattels,&mdash;they were recognized as
men, and had made a contract for service
which their masters could not at pleasure annul.
We have seen that the trade in slaves
is an extensive and lucrative business.</p>

<p>7. The Hebrew law regarded servants as
naturally equal to their masters, and hence,
they were allowed to marry into their master&rsquo;s
family, and inherit, under some circumstances,
their master&rsquo;s property. Deut. 21: 10-14. A
slave is not regarded as a man, can own nothing,
and inherit nothing. What a contrast!
American slavery, and Hebrew servitude seem
to be erected upon totally different foundations.</p>

<p>8. At stated periods the mild form of servitude
instituted by the law of Moses expired.
A Hebrew who became a servant could not be
required to continue in that relation more than
six years. And every fiftieth year was a grand
Jubilee, at the commencement of which liberty
was proclaimed throughout all the land unto
<i>all the inhabitants thereof</i>. Lev. 25: 10, 11.
Contracts for service, under any circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
could not hold beyond that great jubilee. It
was a glorious institution, and a type of the
proclamation of the gospel. But American
slavery knows no joyful jubilee! For three
hundred years no proclamation of freedom has
been made throughout all this land unto all
the inhabitants thereof. No, generation after
generation of slaves goes down to their graves in
<i>despair</i>! Slavery is without a jubilee.</p>

<p>9. The grand design of the introduction of
foreign servants into the Jewish state was their
salvation. From a careful examination of this
whole subject, we are fully satisfied that the
25th chapter of Lev. contains, as Mr. Smith
has said, &ldquo;the constitution of Heaven&rsquo;s first
Missionary society, by which a door of mercy
and salvation was opened to the heathen,
through which they could obtain access to the
altar of God, find mercy and live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be observed that a foreigner could obtain
a permanent residence in Israel in but two
ways,&mdash;1st By becoming a servant in a Jewish
family, and, 2d By purchasing a house in a
walled city. Now, when in connection with
these facts, we consider that to the Jews were
committed the &ldquo;lively oracles;&rdquo; that the only
temple of God on earth was erected on Mt.
Moriah; that the divinely appointed priesthood
and sacrifices were in Jerusalem; and also that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a renunciation of idolatry and hearty acceptance
of the God and religion of the bible was
absolutely required of those foreigners who desired
to become servants; that when they did
become servants they were blessed with all the
precious privileges of the Jewish religion, and
after a few years, became, with their families,
adopted members of the Jewish state, having
all the rights, immunities and honors of the
chosen people of God; I say, when all these
facts are impartially weighed, they convince us
that the <i>end</i> of the provision alluded to for the
admission of foreign servants was religious&mdash;the
salvation of those servants.</p>

<p>And history affords a powerful argument in
support of this position. What was the practical
operation of the law of Moses in relation
to foreign servants? If the pro-slavery view
of that law be correct, then history would record
the fact that the commonwealth of Israel
was a slaveholding commonwealth. It would
state that the Jews traded in men, and that
this traffic was important. We should read of
poor, ignorant, chained idolaters traveling in
mournful procession to a great slave pen at
Jerusalem, situated under the shadow, perhaps
of the temple of God, and from thence into
every part of the land. And when our Savior
appeared, he would have come into contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
with those wretched slaves, and would have
said something about them. Do we find these
facts in history? No, not one of them. Jerusalem,
thank God, was a free city. Judea a free
state. Foreigners were employed from age to
age, as servants, but as was contemplated,
they embraced the religion of God, became
adopted citizens and were fully identified with
the commonwealth of Israel. &ldquo;After circumcision
they were,&rdquo; as Jahn says, &ldquo;recorded
among the Hebrews,&rdquo; and after the jubilee
they enjoyed all the immunities of the children
of Abraham. Such was the intention, and
such the results of Levitical servitude. Between
that system and American slavery there
is scarcely any thing in common. Slavery
originated in piracy, is a system of savage
tyranny, degrading to the intellect, destructive
of morality, blasting to hope and happiness,
and tending to barbarism and crime. Servitude
under the law of Moses, originated in a
benevolent desire to open a door of hope to
the heathen, was kind and just in its requirements,
guarding with extreme jealousy the interest
of servants, and admirably calculated
to lead their minds to morality, virtue and the
knowledge of God. Slavery, therefore, can
find no sanction in the law of Moses. Why,
if that law were applied to American slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
it would abolish it. Compel slaveholders to
use their slaves as the law of Moses required
servants to be used, and you will soon see an
end of slavery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
Slavery and Religion&mdash;Continued.<br />
<span class="smaller">NEW TESTAMENT AND SLAVERY.</span></h2>

<p>Our Lord&rsquo;s New Testament is the bulwark
of human freedom. Its great, broad, solid
truths constitute an impregnable foundation
for a temple of liberty capacious enough to
hold the entire human race. This is the last
book in the world to search in order to find
any thing favorable to oppression; and oppressors
have usually preferred to &ldquo;burrow amid
the types and shadows of the ancient economy.&rdquo;
An effort has been made, however, to wrest a
sanction for the abomination of slavery out of
this last and best revelation from heaven, and
to convert some passages found in the writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of the apostles into chains and fetters to bind
in hopeless bondage those very persons for
whom Christ died.</p>

<p>We will quote the passages usually adduced
to prove that it is the duty of some men to be
slaves, and of others to be slaveholders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Servants, be obedient to them that are <i>your</i>
masters according to the flesh, with fear and
trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto
Christ; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers;
but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart; with good will doing service,
as to the Lord, and not to men; knowing
that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the
same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he
be bond or free. And ye masters, do the same
things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing
that your Master also is in heaven; neither
is there respect of persons with him.&rdquo; Eph.
6: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. &ldquo;Servants, obey in all things
<i>your</i> masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service,
as men-pleasers; but in singleness of
heart, fearing God.&rdquo; Col. 3: 22. &ldquo;Let as many
servants as are under the yoke count their
own masters worthy of all honour, that the
name of God and <i>his</i> doctrine be not blasphemed.
And they that have believing masters, let
them not despise <i>them</i>, because they are brethren;
but rather do <i>them</i> service, because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit.
These things teach and exhort.&rdquo; 1st Tim. 6:
1, 2. &ldquo;<i>Exhort</i> servants to be obedient unto
their own masters, <i>and</i> to please <i>them</i> well
in all <i>things</i>; not answering again; not purloining,
but showing all good fidelity; that they
may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in
all things.&rdquo; Titus, 2: 9, 10. &ldquo;Masters, give
unto your servants that which is just and equal;
knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.&rdquo;
Col. 4: 1.</p>

<p>We will inquire in the first place whether
these passages teach that it is the duty of some
persons to be <i>slaves</i>. And it may be remarked
that if a class of human beings <i>ought</i> to sustain
this horrible relation, the law requiring
them to do so, should be written in the plainest
possible manner. If any one should claim
<i>me</i> and <i>my</i> family as slaves, upon a pretense
that God had authorized our enslavement, I
would demand a warrant for so terrible a degradation,
which no reasonable man could question.
Let us see whether the scriptures cited
prove <i>unquestionably</i> that to live in a state of
slavery is a duty which God requires.</p>

<p>1. It will be seen at a glance that there is
not a word said about <i>slaves</i> in any of these
quotations. The word <i>slave</i> or <i>slaves</i> is not
once used! And yet these passages, inculca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>ting
the duties of <i>servants</i>, have been rung in
the ears of our poor <i>slaves</i> for the last three
hundred years, by hypocritical preachers and
slaveholders, as if heaven were chiefly interested
and delighted in the perpetuation of an institution
which degrades millions of men to a
point as low as manhood can possibly descend.
The whole gospel preached to slaves is mixed
up with this satanic perversion. Even the
song of angels announcing &ldquo;peace on earth
and good will to men,&rdquo; is accompanied to the
ear of the American bondman, with the base,
coarse corruption,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Slaves</i>, obey your masters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. The word <i>servants</i>, used in these scriptures,
is not synonymous with the word <i>slaves</i>, as the
preachers of oppression assume. The word
<i>andrapodon</i> means slave, but that word, the
learned tell us, does not occur in the sacred
writings. The word <i>douloi</i>, used in the above
quotations, and translated servants, means
precisely what our English word servants means,
as that word is understood in free countries.
&ldquo;Our English word servant,&rdquo; says a good authority,
&ldquo;is an exact translation of the Greek
word <i>doulos</i>. And to translate it into the definite
word slave is a gross violation of the original.
Our translators of the scriptures have
uniformly translated the word doulos into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
word servant, <i>never</i> into the word slave, and for
the reason that it never means slave. The
apostles addressed servants in general, but
never slaves in particular; and therefore the
term slave (andrapodon) is not found in apostolic
writings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word <i>doulos</i> occurs in the New Testament
one hundred and twenty two times,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and
in no case has it been translated slave. To
show the utter fallacy of the assumption that
it is synonymous with slave, permit us to supply
<i>slave</i> in a few passages where <i>doulos</i> occurs,
instead of servant, for if slave and servant
mean the same thing, they may be used interchangeably
without violating the sense. &ldquo;Paul
and Timotheus the <i>slaves</i> of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
&ldquo;These are the <i>slaves</i> of the Most High God
which do show unto us the way of salvation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And a voice came out of the throne, saying,
Praise our God all ye his <i>slaves</i>, and ye that
fear him small and great.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am thy fellow
<i>slave</i>.&rdquo; We might extend these quotations indefinitely,
but a sufficient number have been
given to show the absurdity of the assumption
that the words servant and slave describe the
same relation. The pro-slavery rendering
of doulos, would make slaves of all the redeem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ed,
and of the holy angels, and would, as Mr.
Smith remarks, extend the territory of slavery
over heaven itself.</p>

<p>3. The phrase &ldquo;servants under the yoke&rdquo;
means no more than obligation to perform service
according to agreement or contract. He
who had an engagement with an unbelieving
master should perform his contract, or fulfill
his obligation with scrupulous fidelity in order
that the name of God and his doctrine be not
blasphemed. The word &ldquo;yoke&rdquo; does not necessarily
imply slavery. Our Savior said &ldquo;take
my <i>yoke</i> upon you,&rdquo; but certainly he did not
invite any one to become a slave. The word
yoke is used in the scriptures to represent the
ceremonial law; &ldquo;dominion of Jacob over Esau,
in the matter of his father&rsquo;s blessing;&rdquo; political
subjugation of the Israelites; the authority of
king David over his subjects, etc., etc.; but not
in a single passage in the scriptures, unless it
be in 1st Tim. 6: 1, does it describe the state of
a domestic slave, and the assumption that it
means slave in this place is altogether without
proof to sustain it.</p>

<p>4. There is one passage in the New Testament
addressed to servants which has not yet
been quoted. &ldquo;Servants be subject to your
masters with all fear; not only to the good and
gentle, but also to the froward. For this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward
God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.&rdquo; 1st
Pet. 2: 18, 19. In this passage <i>doulos</i> does not
occur, but <i>oiketes</i>, which some suppose, means
<i>slave</i>. But of this evidence is wanting. The
same word is used four times only in the New
Testament, and is, in no case, translated slave.
(See Luke 16: 13. Acts 10: 7. Rom. 14: 4.
1st Pet. as above.) In one place it is rendered
household-servant, and it seems to be used to
distinguish <i>house</i>-servants from others. &ldquo;The
word comes from oikos, a house.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>5. If the sacred writers above quoted had
intended to address slaves, they would, in the
first place, have done so plainly by <i>calling</i> them
slaves. In the second place the directions
would have been applicable to persons in a
state of slavery. As to the terms used in the
directions, we have seen that they do not apply
properly to slaves; and the directions themselves
afford proof that they were given to persons
who were not chattel slaves. The advice
and exhortations imply freedom from <i>absolute
authority</i> and a power of choice not compatible
with slavery. They are exhorted to
perform service &ldquo;<span class="smcap">As the servants of Christ,
doing the will of God from the heart</span>.&rdquo; That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
is, they were to be actuated by the highest motives,
and were not to toil as the servants of
men, but of God. Again, they are advised
not to &ldquo;<span class="small">DESPISE</span>&rdquo; their masters. Such directions
have no pertinence, if addressed to human
chattels. To whom then were they addressed?
We answer, to voluntary laborers or servants
who received a compensation for their work.
The relations of servant and master or laborer
and employer are necessary, legitimate and
honorable relations. All men have not the
skill to acquire or manage capital, and capital
is essential to the accomplishment of great enterprises,
to the march of improvement, and
the progress of civilization. Capital invested
in railroads, canals, machinery, factories, ships,
merchandise, etc., requires many laborers to
manage it; and the directions we are considering
require that those laborers be honest, faithful,
pleasant, and industrious in the discharge
of the duties they engage to perform. And
even though an employer be not a very good
man, as is often the case with men of capital,
christian servants or laborers are instructed to
attend to their duties in the fear of God and
in a manner that will recommend to those employers
the religion which they profess. Yea,
though servants have an engagement with a
hard-hearted, overbearing, abusive heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
master, the apostles would have them perform
their part, with the utmost fidelity, suffering
&ldquo;<i>wrongfully</i>&rdquo; if need be, for the sake of Christ.
These directions are judicious, and their observance
would work to the advantage of laborers
in all countries.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that those scriptures do not
teach unquestionably that it is the duty of some
persons to be slaves. If the apostles had said,
&ldquo;slaves be obedient to your masters for you are
their <i>property</i> and they have a right to you
and all you can earn, <i>because</i> you are property,&rdquo;
then the matter would have been settled. Then
we should admit that <i>some</i> men ought to be
slaves, but upon the heels of this admission
would follow a question very difficult to settle
viz: <i>Who is to obey</i> the command to be a slave?
How is it to be determined who shall become
a human chattel and who the owner of said
chattel?</p>

<p>But the assertion that God requires men to
be slaves is a wicked assertion. It charges
God with folly and inconsistency. He desires
the elevation of man, but slavery brutalizes
him. He encourages the enlightenment
of the mind and the expansion of the understanding,
but slavery darkens the mind and enchains
the understanding. God cannot be
pleased with the ignorance, stupor, injustice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and servile wretchedness which are necessary
to the very existence of slavery, and hence he
can not make it the duty of any man to be a
slave, for this would be the same as to make
it his duty to be stupid, ignorant and wretched.
No, God does not will that any man or
woman should be a slave. Man was made in
the image of God&rsquo;s independence and sovereignty.
The instinct of freedom is strong in
his bosom. It has resisted oppression in all
ages, and it will resist it, with God on its side,
until it shall triumph!</p>

<p>We will now inquire whether the apostolic
addresses to masters authorize some men to
sustain the relation of <i>slaveholders</i>. It should
be observed that there are but two places in
the New Testament in which the duties of masters
are pointed out. Permit us to repeat those
duties. &ldquo;And ye masters do the same things
unto them, forbearing threatening, knowing
that your master also is in heaven.&rdquo; &ldquo;Masters
give unto your servants that which is just and
equal, knowing that ye also have a master in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it possible that from these words men will
take license to seize their fellows and convert
them into <i>property</i>; despoil them of all their
rights; deny them an education; banish them
from courts of justice; break up their homes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
take their wages without compensation; drive
them in chain-gangs from state to state, and
whip, beat, and abuse them until they perish
from the earth? Yes, it is possible. This has
been done. &ldquo;Was there ever,&rdquo; said Dr. Wayland,
&ldquo;such a moral superstructure raised
on such a foundation? <span class="spaced">* *</span> If the religion
of Christ allows such a license from such
precepts as these, the New Testament would
be the greatest curse that ever was inflicted on
our race.&rdquo; We remark</p>

<p>1. In these directions there is not the slightest
intimation that the masters addressed were
<i>slaveholders</i> and that the servants in their employ
were slaves. The term slaveholders
(<i>andrapodistais</i>,) is not used in the above passages,
and this term is only once found in the
apostolic writings.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is found in the following
text: &ldquo;Knowing this that the law is not
made for a righteous man, but for the lawless
and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners,
for the unholy and profane, for murderers
of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
for whoremongers, for them that defile
themselves with mankind, for <i>andrapodistais</i>,
(slaveholders or menstealers) for liars, etc.&rdquo; 1st
Tim. 1: 9, 10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>And it is not only a fact that slaveholders are
not addressed in these passages, but <i>the directions
given are such as no slaveholder in the world
can observe</i>. How can a slaveholder give unto
a <i>slave</i> that which is <i>just</i> and <i>equal</i>? The <i>slave</i>
can own nothing, will nothing, inherit nothing,
and hence it is impossible, in the very nature
of the case, for his owner to give him a just
compensation for his labor. And the <i>slave</i> has
a just right to <i>himself</i> to <i>liberty</i> and the very
first honest and enlightened effort of a slaveholder
to give to his slave that which is just
and equal would result in his <i>emancipation</i>!
<i>Justice</i> and <i>equality</i> are incompatible with slaveholding.
<i>Injustice</i> and <i>inequality</i> are its essential
principles. Let us hear Mrs. <span class="smcap">Stowe&rsquo;s</span> comment
on what Christian legislators have seemed
to consider <i>just</i> and <i>equal</i> when making laws
for slaves:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;First, they commence by declaring that their
brother shall no longer be considered as a person,
but deemed, sold, taken, and reputed, as a
chattel personal.&mdash;This is &ldquo;just and equal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This being the fundamental principle of the
system, the following are specified as its consequences:</p>

<p>1. That he shall have no right to hold property
of any kind, under any circumstances.&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>2. That he shall have no power to contract
a legal marriage, or claim any woman in par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ticular
for his wife.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>3. That he shall have no right to his children,
either to protect, restrain, guide or educate.&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>4. That the power of his master over him
shall be <span class="small">ABSOLUTE</span>, without any possibility of
appeal or redress in consequence of any injury
whatever.</p>

<p>To secure this, they enact that he shall not
be able to enter suit in any court for any cause.&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>That he shall not be allowed to bear testimony
in any court where any white person is
concerned.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>That the owner of a servant, for &ldquo;malicious,
cruel, and excessive beating of his slave, cannot
be indicted.&rdquo;&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>It is further decided, that by no indirect mode
of suit, through a guardian, shall a slave obtain
redress for ill-treatment. (Dorothea v.
Coquillon et al, 9 Martin La. Rep. 350.)&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>5. It is decided that the slave shall not only
have no legal redress for injuries inflicted by
his master, but shall have no redress for those
inflicted by any other person, unless the injury
impair his property value.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>Under this head it is distinctly asserted as
follows:</p>

<p>There can be no offence against the peace
of the state, by the mere beating of a slave,
unaccompanied by any circumstances of cruelty,
or an intent to kill and murder. The peace
of the state is not thereby broken.&rdquo; (State v.
Manner, 2 Hill&rsquo;s Rep. S. C.)&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>If a slave strike a white, he is to be condemned
to death; but if a master kill his slave
by torture, no white witnesses being present,
he may clear himself by his own oath. (Louisiana.)&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>The law decrees fine and imprisonment to
the person who shall release the servant of
another from the torture of the iron collar.
(Louisiana.)&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>It decrees a much smaller fine, without imprisonment,
to the man who shall torture him
with red-hot irons, cut out his tongue, put out
his eyes, and scald or maim him. (Ibid.)&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>It decrees the same punishment to him who
teaches him to write as to him who puts out
his eyes.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>As it might be expected that only very ignorant
and brutal people could be kept in a
condition like this, especially in a country where
every book and every newspaper are full of
dissertations on the rights of man, they therefore
enact laws that neither he nor his children
to all generations, shall learn to read and write.&mdash;Just
and equal!</p>

<p>And as, if allowed to meet for religious worship,
they might concert some plan of escape
or redress, they enact that &ldquo;no congregation
of negroes, under pretence of divine worship,
shall assemble themselves; and that every slave
found at such meetings shall be immediately
corrected <i>without trial</i>, by receiving on the bare
back twenty-five stripes with a whip, switch or
cowskin.&rdquo; (Law of Georgia, Prince&rsquo;s Digest,
p. 447.)&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the servant is thus kept in ignorance,
nevertheless in his ignorance he is punished
more severely for the same crimes than
freemen.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>By way of protecting him from over-work,
they enact that he shall not labor more than
five hours longer than convicts at hard labor
in a penitentiary!</p>

<p>They also enact that the master or overseer,
not the slave, shall decide when he is too sick
to work.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>If any master, compassionating this condition
of the slave, desires to better it, the law
takes it out of his power, by the following decisions:</p>

<p>1. That all his earnings shall belong to his
master, notwithstanding his master&rsquo;s promise
to the contrary; thus making him liable for
his master&rsquo;s debts.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>2. That if his master allow him to keep cattle
for his own use, it shall be lawful for any
man to take them away, and enjoy half the
profits of the seizure.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>3. If his master sets him free, he shall be
taken up and sold again.&mdash;Just and equal!</p>

<p>If any man or woman runs away from this
state of things, and, after proclamation made,
does not return, any two justices of the peace
may declare them outlawed, and give permission
to any person in the community to kill
then by any ways or means they think fit.&mdash;Just
and equal!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="right">(<i>See Key, pp. 241.</i>)
</p></blockquote>

<p>If slaveholding is an illustration of what St.
Paul meant by justice and equality, who can
tell what is injustice and inequality? Let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
be understood that a slaveholder cannot give
to a slave, <i>while he holds him as a slave</i>, that
which is <i>just</i> and <i>equal</i>, because the greatest
injustice and inequality enters into the very nature
of the relation of slaveholder. Could a man
be a <i>just</i> robber or an <i>honest</i> thief? No, because
injustice and dishonesty enter necessarily
into the business of robbing and stealing.
Even so is it impossible for justice and equality
to enter into slaveholding, because, it is in
its very nature, robbery, theft, extortion, oppression,
and a complication of almost all villainies.</p>

<p>It is clear from the examination of all the
passages in the New Testament relating to
masters and servants, that those masters were
not slaveholders and that those servants were
not slaves.</p>

<p>But it will be asked did not slavery exist in
the apostles&rsquo; days? We answer it did exist.
The Roman government tolerated chattel slavery.
Why then did not the apostles regulate
it by prescribing the duties of slaveholders and
slaves? It has been assumed, and justly too,
that &ldquo;slavery no more than murder <i>can</i> be regulated.
That which is essentially and eternally
wrong has nothing in it on which the claim
of morality can rest. Morality requires its
destruction, not its regulation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
God does not point out the duties of liars, adulterers
and thieves, because as such, they can
have no duties. So God did not attempt to
regulate Roman slavery which was a most vile
and crushing despotism. He did not intend
that <span class="small">SLAVERY</span> should be continued, and hence it
was not to be regulated but destroyed. We
have no evidence in the above passages that
<span class="small">SLAVEHOLDERS</span> were admitted into the church
of Jesus Christ by the apostles.</p>

<p>Slaveholders and the upholders of the infamous
Fugitive Slave Law, lay the case of
Onesimus to their consciences as a healing
unction when dogging down the fugitive slave.
In their blindness they assume that Philemon
was a slaveholder, Onesimus a slave, and St.
Paul a slave-catcher. But not a word of this
is true.</p>

<p>1. Onesimus was a <span class="small">SERVANT</span> and not a <span class="small">SLAVE</span>,
and Philemon was not a <span class="small">SLAVEHOLDER</span>. The
assumption that the one was a slave and the
other a slave-owner is altogether without support.</p>

<p>2. Onesimus was not <i>forcibly</i> sent back. St.
Paul did not arrest him, and send him in chains
to Philemon, charging the expense to the government.</p>

<p>3. He was not sent back as a <i>servant</i>, much
less a <i>slave</i>. How then? Why as a &ldquo;brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
beloved.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou therefore receive him as
mine own bowels&mdash; <span class="spaced">* *</span> receive him as myself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If he oweth thee ought put that on
mine account.&rdquo; These directions are wholly
inconsistent with the idea of slavery. If Onesimus
was the <i>property</i> of Philemon, Paul knew
that he owed the service of his whole life. But
Onesimus was no slave. Had he been a slave
Paul would have said, &ldquo;Receive him not as a
slave (<i>andrapodon</i>) but above a slave,&rdquo; instead
of saying, &ldquo;not as a servant (<i>doulos</i>) but above a
servant.&rdquo; Onesimus was a relative of Philemon,
probably a natural brother,&mdash;brother &ldquo;in
the flesh;&rdquo; as may be inferred from Philem., verse
16. He was undoubtedly a young man of
great promise, and was not only entrusted with
the epistle of Paul to Philemon, but jointly
with Tychicus was the bearer of the venerable
apostle&rsquo;s letter to the church at Colosse. On
the authority of Calmet, and indeed of Ignatius,
it is affirmed that he succeeded Timothy
as bishop of Ephesus.</p>

<p>They who affirm that the New Testament
writers sanctioned Roman slavery, seem not to
be aware of the serious imputation they cast
upon that book and its authors. Look at that
awful despotism, that you may understand
what a savage, scaly, bloody-mouthed beast
was welcomed into the church and baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with a Christian baptism, if we may believe
the advocates of human bondage.</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;The (Roman) slave had no protection
against the avarice, rage, or lust of the master,
whose authority was founded in absolute
property; and the bondman was viewed less as
a human being subject to arbitrary dominion,
than as an inferior animal, dependent wholly
on the will of his overseer.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>2. &ldquo;He might kill, mutilate or torture his
slaves for any or no offence; he might force
them to become gladiators or prostitutes.</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;The temporary unions of male with female
slaves were formed and dissolved at his
command; families and friends were separated
when he pleased.</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;Slaves could have no property but by
the sufferance of their masters.</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;While slaves turned the handmill they
were generally chained, and had a broad wooden
collar to prevent them from eating the grain.</p>

<p>6. &ldquo;The runaway when taken was severely
punished, <span class="spaced">* * *</span> sometimes with crucifixion,
amputation of a foot, or by being sent to fight
as a gladiator with wild beasts; but most frequently
by being branded on the brow with letters
indicative of his crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>7. &ldquo;By a decree passed by the Senate, if a
master was murdered when his slaves might
possibly have aided him, all his household
within reach were held as implicated and deserving
of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it possible that the holy apostles gave
their sanction to a system based on such laws?</p>

<p>But all the fundamental principles of revealed
religion are against slavery.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The character of god.</span>&mdash;God is <i>just</i> and
cannot favor a system which disregards all the
principles of justice. But slavery outrages
every principle of justice: therefore God must
be opposed to slavery. God is <i>impartial</i>,&mdash;no
respecter of persons, and he cannot be favorable
to a system which is based upon partiality.
But slavery is a system of superlative
partiality: hence God is opposed to slavery.
God is <i>love</i>,&mdash;and love wills the highest
happiness of the intelligent universe, and the
removal of every obstruction to the progress
of men to that happiness. But slavery obstructs
that progress. It is a barbarizing system,
necessarily involving millions of men in
ignorance, crime and misery: therefore God
must will its extirpation. All the divine attributes
are hostile to slavery. &ldquo;Thus saith the
Lord, execute ye judgment and righteousness,
and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
oppressor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Learn to do well; seek judgment,
relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless; plead
for the widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The common origin of man.</span>&mdash;The unity of
the human race is admitted by all scientific
men, and the bible plainly teaches us that &ldquo;out
of one blood hath God made all nations to
dwell upon the face of the earth.&rdquo; Whatever
difference of feature, color, intellect or stature,
may be found in the various parts of the globe,
is attributable to manners, climate, education,
and the pleasure the Creator has in variety.
Every human being is a <i>man</i>, possessing all
the rights of a man. All men are brothers,
born into the world on a common level. Hence
one man cannot claim his brother and his brother&rsquo;s
family without committing an outrageous
insult. If the right to claim belongs to any, it
belongs to all, and now whose right shall hold?
We say if the right to enslave belongs to any
it belongs to all, and how is it to be determined
who will sink from the right to own slaves to
the condition of a <span class="small">SLAVE</span>? Must the strong reduce
to slavery the weak, and thus make might
the <i>arbiter</i>? Such a conclusion would be contrary
to the plainest dictates of reason. If
men have a common parentage, and are brothers,
they inherit common rights, and those
rights ought to be respected. That system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
which authorizes one part of the common family
of man to plunder another part of their
dearest rights&mdash;of <i>all</i> their rights, is a wrong
system. But slavery authorizes this very thing:
therefore slavery is wrong.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of all.</span>&mdash;Jesus
is the second Adam, and sustains a relation
to the human family co-extensive with the
first Adam. He is the Mediator, High Priest
and Elder Brother of every child of man. All
have been purchased with a priceless offering;
and hence the claims of Christ are paramount
to all other claims, and no one can rightfully
become the owner of a fellow-being, unless
Christ as Creator and Redeemer first relinquish
his claim. A system which should attempt
forcibly, and without divine permission,
to seize upon the Saviour&rsquo;s purchase, would be
robbery&mdash;a robbery of God. But slavery does
seize upon the purchase of a Saviour&rsquo;s blood
without divine permission: therefore slavery is
robbery&mdash;robbery of God.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">The Moral Precepts of Christianity.</span>&mdash;The
moral precepts of Christianity condemn
slavery. Take for example the golden rule&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore
all things whatsoever ye would that
men should do unto you, do ye even so unto
them.&rdquo; Can any slaveholder obey this precept?
If that wealthy planter who stands at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the head of a large family, were a slave with
all his household, what course would he have
his owner pursue? Would he not wish him to
grant a deed of immediate manumission to all
his family and to himself? Would he not
urge the matter as one of immense importance?
Is it possible that he could desire to be
deprived of liberty, education, permanent family
connections, and of the proceeds of his
toil? Could any sane man wish to have his
sons and daughters grow up in the stupor, ignorance,
and miseries of slavery? No, it is
not possible. Every sound-minded man would
regard the subjugation of himself and family
to slavery as a dreadful calamity, and would
consider the man who should <i>hold</i> them in that
condition as an unfeeling, inhuman tyrant.&mdash;Therefore
no sound-minded man can hold a
slave without violating the golden rule&mdash;without
doing unto others as he would <i>not</i> have
others do to him.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">The commandments are all against slavery.</span>
&ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother.&rdquo; But
slavery places the master between the child
and the parent, and makes it impossible for
the child practically to obey this command, in
the performance of those duties which cheer
the hearts and lighten the burdens of parents,
especially in old age. &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
But slavery authorizes in many cases the killing
of slaves. &ldquo;In North Carolina, any person
may lawfully kill a slave who has been
outlawed by running away or lurking in the
swamps.&rdquo; &ldquo;By a law of South Carolina, a
slave endeavoring to entice another slave to
run away, if provisions, etc., be prepared to
aid in such running away, shall be punished
with death.&rdquo; &ldquo;Another law of the same
State, provides that if a slave when absent
from the plantation, refuse to be examined by
any white person, such white person may seize
and chastise him; and if the slave shall <i>strike</i>
such person, he may be <i>lawfully killed</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
shalt not commit adultery.&rdquo; But female
slaves are compelled to commit adultery.
The law places them wholly within the power
of their masters and overseers, and they dare
not, they cannot resist their demands. &ldquo;Thou
shalt not steal.&rdquo; But slavery exists by theft.
Every slave is a stolen man. Every slaveholder
is a man-stealer. The slave was stolen
from Africa, or stolen from his rightful owner,
himself, in America. No sophistry can make
it plausible that the African slave trade is piracy,
and that the <i>perpetuation</i> of slavery is an
innocent business. It is theft as clearly to go
to the negro hut in Virginia and steal a babe as
to go to a hut in Africa and do the same deed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Certainly a child born in our happy Republic
is as free in the sight of God as one born under
the rule of the King of Dahomey! &ldquo;All
are created free,&rdquo; hence the holding of any
one as a slave is <i>theft</i> persevered in. &ldquo;Thou
shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.&rdquo;
But slavery does bear false witness
against the slave, who is our neighbor. It denies
his natural equality, his right to liberty,
property&mdash;in short, his manhood. This is all as
<i>false</i> as false can be. &ldquo;Thou shalt not covet.&rdquo;
But slavery covets not only a man&rsquo;s property,
but the man himself. We see that slavery violates
every commandment of the second table
of the Decalogue, and indeed violates every
precept of the first table, as might readily be
shown.</p>

<p>It is clear that slavery receives no sanction
from the curse pronounced upon Canaan, from
patriarchal servitude, from the law of Moses,
nor from the law of Christ. In the light of the
divine word it appears a gigantic barbarism, full
of hate to the human brotherhood. It annuls
the law of God respecting the family and society.
It obstructs the progress of education
and religion. It is condemned by the whole
spirit of revealed religion. Only a devil could
pray for its perpetuation and extension. It is
not only a sin, but a combination of stupen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>dous
sins&mdash;&ldquo;the sum of all villainies,&rdquo; in the
language of Wesley, &ldquo;an enormity and a
crime, for which perdition has scarcely an adequate
punishment,&rdquo; in the language of Clarke.
&ldquo;Slavery,&rdquo; said the celebrated Jabez Bunting,
&ldquo;is always wrong, essentially, eternally, incurably
wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
American Churches and Slavery.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE POSITION THEY OCCUPY.</span></h2>

<p>The christian church ought to be a faithful
exponent of the benevolent spirit and doctrines
of Jesus Christ. Liberty, truth and
humanity, though insulted, betrayed and proscribed
every where else, should find within
its sacred enclosures a welcome, a refuge and
a stronghold. Its watchmen ought to be
faithful men, uninfluenced by flattery, uncorrupted
by gold, unawed by the popular will.
The church ought to be the most independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
body on earth. Standing as it does upon
the Eternal Rock, holding the promise of successful
resistance against the &ldquo;gates of hell,&rdquo;
and of certain triumph over all the powers of
darkness, the oppressor ought to know that he
could not intimidate it by menace, silence
its witnesses, win its smiles, or by any means
be permitted to set his unhallowed feet within
its pale. The church ought to be a terror to
slaveholders; and although usage, prejudice,
pride, passion, wealth, literature, and the selfish
interests of men should all be combined
against the oppressed, they should be certain of
an unswerving and powerful friend and advocate
in the church.</p>

<p>We say such should be the acknowledged
and indisputable character and conduct of
that body popularly known as the church,
because then it would be a faithful exponent
of the divine philanthropy of Jesus, of his
&ldquo;good will to men,&rdquo;&mdash;then it would be precisely
what the church was when it acknowledged
no law superior to the will of God.</p>

<p>We propose now to ascertain the position
of the American churches in relation to the
slavery question. The most of them have
been compelled to take some action on this
exciting subject. We shall notice, more especially,
the late action of various denomina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>tions,
both for and against slavery, that the
reader may know precisely where each branch
of the <i>Protestant</i> churches of this country, may
be found. We do not deem it necessary to exhibit
the relation of the <i>Catholic</i> church to slavery.
We may remark here, however, by the
way, that this church, if it be proper to call it
a church, is soundly pro-slavery, and is, in
America, as it is everywhere else, a staunch
advocate of oppression. Few Protestant
churches excel the Catholic in slaveholding.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Presbyterian (Old School.)</span></h3>

<p>The Presbyterian church (O.S.) stands fully
and unequivocally on the side of the oppressor.
It is true that a few earnest anti-slavery men
may be found in this denomination, but their
influence upon it is scarcely felt. They are
not able in the least to modify the decided,
unfaltering pro-slavery position maintained by
the General Assembly. So far as I know, the
most ultra friends of slavery are perfectly satisfied
with the late ecclesiastical action and influence
of this church. It makes no pretensions
to anti-slavery. The slaveholder is welcomed
to its communion, is authorized to preach
and is elevated to the highest posts of honor.
At the last General Assembly fifty slaveholding
presbyteries were represented. The place of
meeting was Charleston, South Carolina. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Lord, author of a celebrated sermon in support
of the fugitive slave law, was elected moderator.
The General Assembly of 1845, by a
vote of 168 to 13, &ldquo;Resolved, That the existence
of domestic slavery, under the circumstances
in which it is found in the southern
portion of this country, is no bar to Christian
communion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This church has been <i>progressing</i> in the
wrong direction. In 1818, before the excision
of the Presbyteries which formed the New
School body, the General Assembly declared
that &ldquo;the voluntary enslaving of one part of
the human race by another was a gross violation
of the most precious and sacred rights of
human nature,&rdquo; &ldquo;utterly inconsistent with the
law of God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;totally irreconcilable with
the spirit and principles of the gospel.&rdquo; This
was a noble declaration, but slaveholders were
not excluded from the church as they should
have been, but continued to flock in, until in
1836, a <i>slaveholder</i> presided over the General
Assembly who openly said&mdash;&ldquo;I draw my warrant
from the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament to hold my slaves in bondage.&rdquo;&mdash;Since
1836 the General Assembly has been
wholly under the control of the pro-slavery
interest. Her doctors of divinity have written
learned treaties in defense of slavery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
slaveholders are at ease, yea, sleep undisturbed
in her communion, and for all that that
church is likely to say or do, will sleep on
until they find themselves in company with
Dives.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Presbyterian (New School.)</span></h3>

<p>When the New School General Assembly
was organized only three slaveholding Presbyteries
were represented. There are now about
twenty. A very large proportion of the ministers
and members of this church are <i>somewhat</i>
anti-slavery, and many of them <i>decidedly</i>
anti-slavery; but the holding of slaves is not
made a test of communion. Slaveholders
have been and are now flocking into it. Ministers
of the sanctuary and members of the
General Assembly are slaveholders. Nevertheless,
the action of the General Assembly
has been such as to keep up an agitation and
render the southern portion of the church
somewhat restless.</p>

<p>The following resolution was adopted by the
General Assembly, which convened at Detroit
in 1850:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;That the holding of our fellow-men in the condition of
slavery, <span class="small">EXCEPT</span> in those cases where it is unavoidable by the
laws of the State, by the obligations of guardianship or the demands
of humanity, is an offense, in the proper import of that
term, as used in the Book of Discipline, chap. i., sec. 3, which
should be treated in the same manner as other offenses.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>exceptions</i> in this resolution are sufficient,
especially when explained at the south,
to cover almost all cases of slaveholding.</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1853 adopted a report
earnestly requesting the Presbyteries in the
slaveholding States to lay before the next
Assembly distinct and full statements touching
the following points:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;1. The number of slaveholders in connection with the churches
under their jurisdiction, and the number of slaves held by them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. The extent to which slaves are held by an unavoidable necessity,
&lsquo;imposed by the laws of the States, the obligations of guardianship,
and the demands of humanity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. Whether a practical regard, such as the Word of God requires,
is evinced by the Southern churches for the sacredness of the
conjugal and parental relations as they exist among slaves; whether
baptism is duly administered to the children of slaves professing
Christianity; whether slaves are admitted to equal privileges and
powers in the Church courts; and in general to what extent and
in what manner provision is made for the religious well-being of the
enslaved.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The debate on this report and the subsequent
action of the southern Presbyteries
prove conclusively that the Detroit resolution
is utterly futile, and that slaveholding goes on
in the southern part of the church without
interruption. On this report, Rev. Mr. McLain,
of Mississippi said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;We disavow the action of the Detroit Assembly. We have
men in our Church who buy slaves, and work them, because they
can make more money by it than any other way. All who
can, own slaves; and those who cannot, want to.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Rev. William Homes, of Mo., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;The action of the Assembly of Detroit is null and void; for
how can any man be found, not to be included in one or the other
of the exceptions contained in it? All claim that their slaveholding
is involuntary and justifiable. He concluded by strenuously
asserting that the South would not submit to these inquiries.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Rev. William Terry, of Va., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;He could not promise that the Virginia Presbyteries would
give any replies to these inquiries. There was no hope, so long as
slavery exists, that the church shall be free from it. If it has come
to be true that the feeling of the North will not suffer the slaveholding
ministers and members to remain in fellowship with the
Church, the South will not remain with you. They do not contemplate
a disconnection with slavery.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the meeting of the Assembly the Presbyteries
in the South have almost unanimously
protested against the action in relation to
slavery as &ldquo;inquisitorial,&rdquo; and have resolved
to disregard totally the &ldquo;earnest request&rdquo; of
the General Assembly. They have also resolved
that the agitation of the subject in the
Assembly must cease as a <i>condition</i> of the
continued union of the church. Whether the
pro-slavery element of this denomination will
prevail, so as to &ldquo;bury out of sight the Detroit
resolution, silence the General Assembly on
slavery, and make the New School Presbyterian
Church a quiet home for those who &ldquo;buy&rdquo;
&ldquo;sell&rdquo; and &ldquo;work&rdquo; slaves &ldquo;because they can
make money out of them,&rdquo; cannot now be de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>termined.
We hope not, but knowing the
aggressive spirit of slavery, we fear.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Congregational.</span></h3>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to define with any
great degree of precision, the position of the
Congregational churches in relation to slavery.
Many of these churches are actively anti-slavery.
The Congregationalists of Ohio, in
a convention held at Mansfield:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Resolved That we regard American slavery as both a great evil
and a great violation of the law of God and the rights of man; and
that we deem it our sacred duty to protest, by every christian
means, against slaveholding, and against any and all acts which
recognize the false and pernicious principle that makes merchandise
of man.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The largest representative body of congregationalists
which has expressed itself on the
question of slavery recently was the Albany
Convention which met in 1852. This body
adopted the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Resolved, That in the opinion of this Convention, it is the tendency
of the gospel, wherever preached in its purity, to correct all
social evils, and to destroy sin in all its forms; and that it is the
duty of Missionary Societies to grant aid to churches in slaveholding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
States in the support of such ministers only as shall so preach the
gospel, and inculcate the principles and application of gospel discipline,
that, with the blessing of God, it shall have its full effect in
awakening and enlightening the moral sense in respect to slavery,
and in bringing to pass the speedy abolition of that stupendous
wrong; and that wherever a minister is not permitted so to preach,
he should, in accordance with the directions of Christ in such cases
&ldquo;depart out of that city.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>It is believed that Congregationalists generally
are <i>progressing</i> in the right direction.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Methodist Episcopal Church (North and South.)</span></h3>

<p>John Wesley pronounced slavery to be the
&ldquo;sum of all villanies.&rdquo; The discipline of the
Methodist Episcopal Church is quite positive
in its condemnation of slavery. Some of the
early Methodist preachers gave no quarters to
this sin. But as the church increased in numbers
and popularity, slaveholders, who at first
came in by mere sufferance, assumed a bolder
position, and finally ruled the whole church
&ldquo;with a rod of iron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The General Conference which convened in
Cincinnati in 1836, after a warm discussion,
adopted the following resolution:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Resolved, By the delegates of the Annual
Conferences, in General Conference assembled,
that we are decidedly opposed to modern
abolitionism, and wholly disclaim any <i>right,
wish, or intention to interfere in the civil and
political relation between the master and slave as
it exists</i> in the slaveholding States of this
Union.&rdquo; Yeas 120, nays 14.</p>

<p>This resolution was an offering to appease
the bloody Moloch of slavery, which had been
aroused somewhat by <i>Orange Scott</i>. At a
Gen. Conf. in 1840, held in Baltimore, a resolution
was passed depriving colored persons
of the right of testifying against white persons.
The resolution reads as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That it is inexpedient and unjustifiable
for any preacher to permit colored persons
to give testimony against white persons,
in any State where they are denied that privilege
by law.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The division of this Church (or secession, as
some call it, of the Church South) has as yet
resulted, so far as we can see, in no advantage
to the slave. The southern portion or branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
is not more pro-slavery than before; and the
northern division occupies precisely the ground
maintained when the resolutions of 1836 and
1840 were adopted, and when there were embraced
within her communion the owners of 200,000
slaves. <span class="smcap">Slaveholding is not a bar to membership
in the Methodist Episcopal Church North.</span>
Ten or eleven conferences are now slaveholding,
and between 30 and 40,000 slaves are
owned at the present time by members of this
church.</p>

<p>The Baltimore Conference, which belongs to
the church North, passed in 1836 the following
resolution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That this Conference disclaims any fellowship with
abolitionism. On the contrary, while it is determined to maintain
its well known, and long established position, by keeping the traveling
preachers composing its own body, free from slavery; it is also
determined not to hold connexion with any ecclesiastical body, that
shall make non-slaveholding a condition of membership in the
Church.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This conference, so far from regarding slaveholding
in the <i>membership</i> a sin, seems to consider
it a virtue, and a condition of fellowship.</p>

<p>An effort to introduce the slavery question
into the last General Conference was defeated,
speakers were choked down, and the conference
closed in disorder. Since the meeting of
that body a number of Conferences have
passed resolutions calling for the adoption of
a rule which would exclude slaveholders from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the church. Some strong men<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> seem determined
not to rest the question until there is
a semblance at least of consistency between
the professions and practice of Methodism on
slavery. This church has been &ldquo;as much as
ever deploring the evils of slavery,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> for scores
of years, and as <i>much as ever</i> strengthening
and building up the iniquity! And as a Methodist
writer in the <i>Northern C. Advocate</i> in a
late article asks&mdash;&ldquo;Is it not high time for honest
and God-fearing anti-slavery ministers and
members of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
to inquire whether in her official position, her
anti-slavery professions and character are not
all a <i>mere sham</i>!&rdquo; It is to be feared that the
good men of this church, who are laboring to
effect its renovation from this foul sin, are
doomed to disappointment, as many others,
who have preceded them, have been. The
fact that three new slaveholding conferences
will be represented in the next General Conference
of this body, augurs unfavorably.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Methodist Protestant Church.</span></h3>

<p>This branch of the Methodist family is fearfully
involved in the sin of slaveholding.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>Slavery
has silenced the voice of the church
organ. Slaveholders have free access to its
communion. The discipline contains a very
disgraceful clause in relation to colored members.
Article 12, Sec. 1st secures the right of
suffrage to all male members who are <span class="small">WHITE</span>.
Article 7, Sec. 3, gives to each annual conference
power to make for colored members of
the church &ldquo;<i>such terms</i> of suffrage&rdquo; as they
may think proper. In the same article the
apparently neutral, but really pro-slavery
character of this church is seen in the following
words: &ldquo;But neither the General Conference
nor any annual conference shall assume
power to interfere with the constitutional powers
of the civil governments, <i>or with the operations
of the civil laws</i>.&rdquo; The civil law is the
highest law recognized in this article, and
where that makes <i>chattels</i> of men, this church
is forbidden to interfere. In these quotations
the principles of <i>caste</i> and <i>lower-lawism</i>, are
most clearly inculcated. It is with surprise
and sorrow that we find such odious features
in the discipline of a church which boasts of
<span class="small">MUTUAL RIGHTS</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wesleyan Methodist Connection.</span></h3>

<p>This denomination of Christians stands boldly
and unequivocally upon the solid bible anti-slavery
platform; and although not a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
body, its influence has already been widely
felt. It comes behind in no anti-slavery gift
or grace. Its pulpit and press <i>speak out</i> earnestly
and powerfully. The Syracuse Conference
recently adopted the following resolutions,
which are such as all the conferences of
the connection pass unanimously:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That we hold&mdash;as ever&mdash;in abhorrence the <i>system</i>,
esteeming it as ranking first in the dark list of systematized piracy,
and all intelligent supporters of the abomination as being nothing,
less or more, than willing pirates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That to ask us to fraternize with any of the thousand
and one organized or unorganized influences, going directly or indirectly
to sustain the system, prominent among which are the principal
churches and the great political parties of the country, is to
offer direct insult to our sense of Christian propriety and gentlemanly
courtesy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baptists (Regular.)</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Regular Baptist</i> Church occupies a decidedly
pro-slavery position. Where slavery
exists, it does not make slaveholding a bar to
communion. It is true that there is a division
between the Northern and Southern Baptist
churches in <i>benevolent operations</i>, but this division
is &ldquo;one, not of principle, but of policy.
Hence, there has been from the first, between
the leaders of the Northern and Southern Associations,
a cordial fraternization.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This
church is very influential in the South, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
no ecclesiastical organization has American
slavery received a more powerful and hearty
sanction. Many Baptists are, however, warm
friends of the slave, but they have not been
able to change or modify in the slightest degree
the pro-slavery position of the general
body.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baptists (Free-will.)</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Free-will Baptist</i> Church is decidedly
anti-slavery. It stands in the front rank of
those societies which are on the side of the
oppressed battling for humanity. Amongst
other excellent resolutions submitted by the
committee on slavery at the last General Conference
the following will show on what platform
to look for a true Free-will Baptist:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That we re-affirm our opposition to the whole system
of American Slavery; holding it to be absurd in the light of Reason,
infamous in the eye of Justice, a deadly foe to human welfare, a
libel on the Decalogue, and a reckless attack on the religion of
Christ; and the only change we would recommend in our denominational
attitude and policy on this subject, is, to take an advanced
position in our warfare against the system, and to give a more open
and public expression to our hostility.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baptists (Seventh-Day.)</span></h3>

<p>The position of this branch of the Baptist
family may be known from the following resolution
passed by the Eastern Association:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That we enter our solemn protest
against the system of American slavery, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
sin against God, and a libel on our national
declaration, that &ldquo;all men are created free and
equal.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Evangelical Association.</span></h3>

<p>The Evangelical Association has inserted in
its discipline the following resolution which
indicates its ecclesiastical position:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Question.</i> What is to be done respecting slaveholders and the
slave-trade?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Answer.</i> We have long since been convinced that the buying
and selling of men and women, and slavery, is a great evil, and
ought to be abhorred by every Christian: be it therefore known to
all fellow-members, that none shall be allowed, under any pretence
or condition whatever, the holding of slaves or the trafficking in
the same.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">The United Brethren in Christ.</span><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></h3>

<p>This church believes slavery to be in itself a
sin. The Constitution, which can only be altered
by a vote of two-thirds of all the members
of the society, declares that &ldquo;involuntary
servitude shall in no way be tolerated.&rdquo; The
32d Section of Discipline reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;All slavery in every sense of the word is totally prohibited, and
shall in no way be tolerated in our Church. Should any be found
in our society who hold slaves, they cannot continue as members
unless they do personally manumit or set free such slaves. And
when it is known to any of our ministers in charge of a circuit,
station or mission, that any of its members hold a slave or slaves, he
shall admonish such member to manumit such slave or slaves; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
if such persons do not take measures to carry out the discipline,
they shall be expelled by the proper authorities of the church; and
any minister refusing to attend to the duties above described shall
be dealt with by the authorities to which he is amenable.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This section, substantially, has been in force
since 1821. The United Brethren have congregations
in Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia and
Maryland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the General Conference, May 12, 1853, the <i>Southern delegates</i>
reported that there were twelve cases of legal connection with
slavery in the Church, but they were of a character so peculiar,
that a difference of opinion had arisen as to whether the discipline
<i>intended</i> to exclude them. The opinion and advice of the Conference
was asked. The following answer, in substance, was
given:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All those cases reported are cases prohibited by the plain letter
of our Discipline. Execute papers of immediate emancipation.&mdash;The
sympathy of this Conference given to palliated cases of slavery
would be an entering wedge of slavery into our Church. The
Church must be disconnected with slavery in all its forms. The
bishops are instructed to carry out the <i>letter</i> of Discipline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The action in this case was taken without a dissenting vote, and
the delegates from the South assured the Conference that the intention
of the Discipline, as above explained, should be executed.</p>

<p>The General Conference made provision for the publication of a
monthly magazine. The following is from the Prospectus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The immediate abolition of slavery; rejecting that most odious
and barbarous notion, that man has a right to hold property in man.
The position will be taken that this is a monster that can never be
tamed, a sin which violates every precept of the Bible. It will be
our object to show that slavery (by which we mean the holding of
property in man) is sinful, necessarily sinful, under all possible and
conceivable circumstances.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Various Churches.</span></h3>

<p>Besides the churches already mentioned the
following are decidedly anti-slavery:&mdash;&ldquo;Associate
Presbyterian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reformed Presbyterian,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Free Presbyterian,&rdquo; (of which the venerable
John Rankin is a member,) many local &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;
churches, and the &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; or Quakers.
The Quakers have a world-wide reputation
for practical philanthropy. And on the
other hand the following large denominations
are decidedly pro-slavery:&mdash;&ldquo;German Reformed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dutch Reformed,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cumberland
Presbyterian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lutheran&rdquo; and &ldquo;Disciple&rdquo; (or
Campbellite.)</p>

<p>The following estimate made by W. G. Gephart,
a Presbyterian minister, will give a &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s
eye view&rdquo; of the relation of the leading denominations
of this country to slavery as it
stood a few years since. At the present time
they are only <i>more deeply</i> involved in the trade
in the souls of men, than they were when this
estimate was made:</p>

<table class="valb" summary="Slaves owned by ministers">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, suppose the average value of all these
slaves be only $400 each, and it will give a
capital of $264,225,200! invested in humanity,
the interests of 660,653 beings upon whom God
has chartered immortality, and stamped it with
the signet of his own image.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this review it will be perceived that
the most influential denominations have given
their sanction to slavery. They have opened
wide their doors to slaveholders, and have welcomed
them to their communion. They have
not advised nor commanded them to emancipate
their slaves as a condition of admission to
the church, to the Lord&rsquo;s table, to the pulpit, or
even into heaven itself!</p>

<p>Divines have, by a perversion of the Bible,
corrupted the consciences of Southern, aye,
even of Northern Christians, by the most subtle
and monstrous errors. The holy Bible has
been made, in the language of Blanchard, a
smith shop whence consecrated hands have
brought fetters for the feet, and manacles for
the mind! &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said Frederick Douglass,
&ldquo;men-stealers for ministers, woman-whippers
for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers
for church-members. The man who wields
the blood-clotted cow-skin during the week fills
the pulpit on Sunday and claims to be a min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>ister
of the meek and lowly Jesus. The man
who robs me of my earnings at the end of
each week, meets me as class-leader on Sunday
morning, to show me the way of life, and
the path of salvation. He who sells my sister,
for purposes of prostitution, stands forth as
the pious advocate of purity. He who proclaims
it a religious duty to read the Bible,
denies me the right of learning to read the
name of God who made me. He who is the
religious advocate of marriage, robs whole
millions of its sacred influence, and leaves
them to the ravages of wholesale pollution.
The warm defender of the sacredness of the
family relation is the same that, scatters whole
families,&mdash;sundering husbands and wives, parents
and children, sisters and brothers,&mdash;leaving
the hut vacant, and the hearth desolate.
We see the thief preaching against theft, and
the adulterer against adultery. We have men
sold to build churches, women sold to support
the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles
for the <i>poor heathen! all for the glory of God
and the good of souls!</i> The slave auctioneer&rsquo;s
bell and the church-going bell chime in with
each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken
slave are drowned in the religious
shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion
and revivals in the slave trade go hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in hand together. The slave prison and the
church stand near each other. The clanking
of fetters and the rattling of chains in the
prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer
in the church may be heard at the same time.
The dealers in the bodies and souls of men,
erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit,
and they mutually help each other. The dealer
gives his blood-stained gold to support the
pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his
infernal business with the garb of Christianity.&rdquo;</p>

Slavery and the Church.<br />
<span class="smaller">NON-FELLOWSHIP WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.</span></h2>

<p>We shall now proceed to show what we
conceive to be the true position of a Christian
church in relation to slavery. It has been
demonstrated that slavery is a complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and monstrous iniquity involving a direct violation
of the whole second table of the Decalogue.
This being an established position it
will not be difficult to determine the relation
which the church should sustain to this sin,
and to those who commit it.</p>

<p>The scriptural position of a Christian and a
Christian society in relation to sin, may be ascertained
from the following quotations: &ldquo;But
I have written unto you not to keep company&mdash;if
any man that is called a brother be a fornicator,
or covetous, or an idolater, or railer,
or drunkard, or extortioner, with such an one,
no, not to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherefore come out from among them,
and be ye separate, saith the Lord; and touch
not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have no fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness, but rather reprove them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we command you brethren, in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw
yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these passages the duty of open and decided
non-fellowship with sinners is unequivocally
asserted. 1. Do not &ldquo;keep company&rdquo; with
covetous persons and extortioners. Do not
&ldquo;eat&rdquo; with them at the sacramental table, for
this would imply a sanction of their sin. 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come out from among them.&rdquo; Let there be
between you a plain line of demarcation so
that the whole world will know that you are
not in favor with their sin, and are not a party
to it. &ldquo;Have <span class="small">NO FELLOWSHIP</span>.&rdquo; Be not united
in any associations which require it. Go not
with them to the sacramental board. Unite not
with them in benevolent efforts for the conversion
of the world, for this would require fellowship.
Have <i>no</i> fellowship. 4. &ldquo;In the name
of the Lord Jesus withdraw yourselves&rdquo;&mdash;cut
off all ties which imply fellowship. Do this
solemnly&mdash;do it in the name of the blessed
Jesus&mdash;do it for the glory of God&mdash;do it as
an act of discipline&mdash;withdraw yourselves from
<i>every</i> disorderly walker&mdash;from every &ldquo;darkness
worker,&rdquo;&mdash;let them be unto you &ldquo;as a heathen
man and a publican.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now how are these scriptures to be obeyed
respecting the great sin of slavery? We answer:
1. The church should debar slaveholders
from its communion. While they remain
impenitent in relation to the monstrous sin of
slavery and refuse to emancipate their slaves,
they should be peremptorily refused admittance
into the fellowship of saints. At the <i>door</i> they
ought to be met by an emphatic &ldquo;No sirs;
your hands are red with blood, your purses are
filled with unjust gains, you rob the widow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the fatherless, you make merchandise of men,
repent, reform, do justly, love mercy, or away
ye men-stealers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. If by any means slaveholders have obtained
a place in the church, they should be
plainly dealt with, according to the directions
given in such cases by the sacred writers, and
in case of a refusal on their part to &ldquo;hear the
church,&rdquo; they should be immediately thrust
out&mdash;accounted as &ldquo;heathen&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;delivered unto
Satan for the destruction of the flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. But in case a church refuses to discipline
slaveholders, as it disciplines other offenders
against God, and on the contrary persistently
retains them in its communion and officially
recognizes them as members of the household
of faith,&mdash;as holy persons,&mdash;as good christians,
then a christian can do no better than
to withdraw from that church. He cannot
remain in it without giving an expressed or
implied sanction to a slaveholding christianity.
The whole force of his piety and influence
will go abroad to create the conviction
that slavery is right and quite consistent with
holiness.</p>

<p>In support of this view of the true position
of a church and of christians in relation to
slavery, the following additional considerations
are submitted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The church is required to be holy. But
it cannot approximate to holiness while welcoming
into its pale sinners such as slaveholders
are, and sanctioning such an impurity
as is slavery.</p>

<p>2. The Church is required to be the &ldquo;pillar
and ground of the truth.&rdquo; But a slaveholding
church wofully perverts and corrupts the truth
in many important particulars. The truth
that God hates oppression and robbery for
instance, is corrupted by it, for it pronounces
the very chief oppressors and robbers the
true children of God, and assures the world
that He approbates their conduct. It corrupts
the truth in relation to the true idea of a christian.
It denies that justice, mercy and love,
are essential attributes of a christian character,
by passing off upon a deluded world a
class of persons as christians who are pre-eminently
unjust, unmerciful, and full of hate
to the human brotherhood.</p>

<p>3. The church should honor the holy scriptures.
But a slaveholding church necessarily
dishonors them. The church is presumed to
be a faithful and competent expounder of the
doctrines and moral precepts of the Bible, and
hence what it approves, it is supposed, the
Bible sanctions, and as it approves of slavery,
it gives currency to the idea that the Bible is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
a pro-slavery book,&mdash;that Christianity is favorable
to oppression, and an enemy to equality
and fraternity. Thus a slaveholding church
dishonors the Word of Truth and is an infidel-making
organization. Non-fellowship with
slaveholding is demanded as a condition of
faithfulness to the Bible.</p>

<p>4. The church is expected to convert the world
to righteousness. But it can never do this
while shielding the Leviathan of sins. Slavery
is a system of barbarism which must necessarily
be destroyed in order to the evangelization
of America and of the world. The tyranny,
injustice and cruelty of masters, and the
ignorance, servility and general degradation
of slaves are inconsistent with christianity,
and to sanction these is to sanction and sustain
sin, and interpose a barrier to the progress
of truth and righteousness. And in addition
to this, a church must have a character to
give it influence with men. A church without
character for disinterestedness, benevolence
and truth, will be despised by men and forsaken
of God. A slaveholding church is without
a good moral character, and hence lacks
moral power. Men will be slow to believe
that, while fiercely defending a monstrous national
sin, it is in earnest in its opposition to
lesser crimes and trivial wrongs. How pow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>erless
is a body of christians whose virtue
gives way under the temptation of a popular
and lucrative vice! How justly branded with
cowardice and hypocrisy!</p>

<p>5. Duty to slaveholders demands non-fellowship
with slaveholding. The course pursued
by the popular churches involves the souls of
slaveholders in imminent peril. Their consciences
are lulled into quietude or narcoticized
by deadly moral nostrums, skillfully prepared
and treacherously administered by time-serving,
fleece-seeking hirelings, who assume
the sacred office of shepherds. Many of them
are not aware of their sin and danger, and
how can they be aroused while honored in the
church and flattered as good christians, and
imitators in the slaveholding business, of the
good old patriarchs? To save these men the
church must be plain with them, and require
repentance of <i>all</i> their sins, and <i>especially</i> of the
sin of slaveholding, as a condition of a place
in the temple of God.</p>

<p>6. Duty to the slave demands non-fellowship
with slaveholding. The oppressed have
a claim upon the church, because Christ died
for them, and they are, while enslaved, in
such a situation that they can neither love
him with all their powers, nor do much to establish
his church and publish his name in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
earth. Hence it is the duty of christians and
christian societies to break off the fetters which
bind not only their limbs but their minds. <span class="smcap">The
American church is able to emancipate every
slave in the land.</span> Who doubts that it is its
duty? But in order to do this glorious work,
the principle of strict non-fellowship with
slaveholders must be adopted. Let every
church in America declare slavery to be a
sin and exclude slaveholders from its communion,
and the doom of slavery will be sealed.
All the laws and compromises and compacts
which the ingenuity of the prince of darkness
could invent would not preserve it. It is the
church which is the bulwark of slavery. Not
one day could it stand up in this country without
the strength imparted to it by a powerful
but awfully corrupted church. &ldquo;Let all the
evangelical denominations,&rdquo; says <i>Albert Barnes</i>,
&ldquo;but follow the simple example of the Quakers
in this country, and slavery would soon
come to an end. There is not vital energy
enough; there is not power of numbers and
influence enough, out of the church, to sustain
it. Let every religious denomination in the
land <i>detach itself</i> from all connection with
slavery, without saying a word against others;
let the time come when, in all the mighty denominations
of Christians, it can be announ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ced
that the evil has ceased <i>with them</i> <span class="small">FOREVER</span>,
and let the voice from each denomination
be lifted up in kind, but firm and solemn
testimony against the system&mdash;with no &lsquo;mealy&rsquo;
words; with no attempt at apology; with no
wish to blink it, with no effort to throw the
sacred shield of religion over so great an evil&mdash;and
the work is done. There is no power
<i>out</i> of the church that could sustain slavery an
hour if it were not sustained <i>in</i> it.&rdquo; Hence
the reasons for non-fellowship with slaveholding
are as vast as the interests temporal and
eternal of millions and millions of our fellow-creatures,
and as vast as the treachery which
leaves them in chains! Depend upon it the
curse of God will come down upon the American
church in a storm of fiery vengeance if it
arise not and do justice to the slave!</p>

<p>7. If slaveholders are admitted to church-fellowship
<i>no class of sinners on earth should be
excluded</i>. The church cannot consistently expel
from its communion the rich man who
grinds the face of the poor laborer that reaps
down his fields, and at the same time retain
the slaveholder who lives <i>entirely</i> upon the unpaid
labor of the poor. He who <i>occasionally</i>
cheats his neighbor out of a few dollars cannot
consistently be censured by the church
while the man who cheats whole families out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of domestic comfort, home, education, and their
all, passes without reproof. The occasional
adulterer cannot receive church discipline in
the presence of him who compels his slaves
to live together without the sanction, and without
the protection of the law. He who steals
a sheep cannot be cast out from a church in
which he who steals men occupies a high seat.
As slaveholding is a violation directly or indirectly
of every commandment of the Decalogue,
if it cannot and must not be disciplined,
then church discipline is useless; and all classes
of sinners should be admitted and retained
in this Holy Temple, unless the principle be
established that he who commits a <i>petty</i> offense
shall be cast out, but he who has the heart and
courage to commit a high offense, a daring
crime, shall remain in full fellowship. I have
wondered how slaveholding church members
could try and expel from a religious society a
poor negro who, in addition to his peck of
corn per week, had stolen a little meat, while
they were conscious of robbing that same
negro of the products of his daily toil, and of
his own soul and body.</p>

<p>8. To maintain its <i>independence</i> the church
must discard fellowship with slaveholders.&mdash;In
no case have slaveholders been willing to
occupy an humble position in a religious body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
long. They assume to be pre-eminently <i>the</i>
members of the church, and the press, pulpit,
and General Assembly or General Conference,
<i>must</i>, unequivocally, endorse, or patriarchalize
their slaveholding. The history of all
the pro-slavery churches in America is proof
of this remark. A few slaveholders are able
to change entirely the action of a powerful
ecclesiastical body&mdash;to range it on the side of
oppression, to silence or subborn its witnesses,
to shut up its sympathies and take away the
bow of hope from the slave. How many of the
hundreds of ministers in the whole south are
free to utter their convictions on slavery to day?
How many religious presses are unfettered?
If then the church would stand upon the solid
rock of truth, unawed by the popular will, uncorrupted
with gold, the immutable friend of
<i>man</i>, proclaiming and enforcing the <i>whole</i> truth,
it must keep out of her communion legalized
and practiced tyrants.</p>

<p>9. Regard for decency, refined sensibility
and common humanity, urges non-fellowship
with slaveholders. The members of a
slaveholding church become insensible to the
grossest outrages upon the better feelings of
slaves, and they habitually commit acts, without
a blush, which, one should think, would
pale the cheek of a demon. For illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
take a well authenticated fact: &ldquo;A runaway
slave in 1841, assigned the following as the
reason why he refused to commune with a
church of which he was a member. &lsquo;The
church,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;had silver furniture for the
administration of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, to procure
which they sold <i>my brother!</i> and I could not
bear the feelings it produced to go forward and
receive the sacrament from the vessels which
were the purchase of my brother&rsquo;s blood!&rsquo;&rdquo;
But the members of that church, generally,
were altogether without feeling upon the subject,
and were as little disturbed in selling a
slave to purchase silver ware for the sacramental
table, or to pay a parson, or to support
a missionary, as in selling a mule for the same
purposes.</p>

<p>10. If slavery be fellowshiped in the church,
then <i>slaveholding preachers</i> will be coming
around and preaching the gospel to us! A
dealer in human flesh will undertake to teach
us to be just and merciful. We will be expected
to receive the elements of the holy sacrament
from hands that use the cowskin occasionally
on the backs of slaves! It is notorious
that churches which fellowship slavery
have an exceedingly dumb and callous ministry
on the subject of oppression. Frederick
Douglass, I think it was, who said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
hardest master he ever served was a Methodist
Protestant preacher. The following incident
will illustrate this thought: &ldquo;A minister of
the gospel owned a female slave, whose husband
was owned by another man in the same
neighborhood. The husband did something
supposed to be an offense sufficient to justify
his master in selling him for the southern market.
As he started, his wife obtained leave to
visit him. She took her final leave of him,
and started to return to her master&rsquo;s house.
She went a few steps and returned and embraced
him again, and started a second time
to go to her master&rsquo;s house; but the feelings
of her heart again overcame her, and she
turned about and embraced him the third time.
Again she endeavored to bear up under the
heavy trial, and return; but it was too much
for her&mdash;she had a woman&rsquo;s heart. She returned
the fourth time, embraced her husband&mdash;and
turned about,&mdash;<span class="small">A MANIAC!</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Anti-slavery
Record.)</p>

<p>Good God! can any one plead for the admission
of such cruelty into the bosom of the
church and into the ministry?</p>

<p>And let it be remembered that this preacher
simply did what the legal relation authorized,
and what all slaveholding ministers may do
without ecclesiastical censure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>11. If slavery be fellowshiped in the church,
then we shall be compelled to sit in religious
meetings, class-meetings and conference meetings,
and hear a good experience told by one
who lives on the toil of wretched slaves, and
who would sell at public sale one of our
own brethren in the Lord, yea, even ourselves,
if the <i>laws</i> would allow it. Take the following
specimen of a Methodist <i>sister</i>, and ask
yourselves how you would like to attend class
with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A poor woman was put in jail about a
week since. It is the jail that cost the people
of the United States nearly, or quite, $60,000.
Had this woman committed crime? Not the
least in the world. Her mistress wants to sell
her, and pocket the money&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. She
puts her into jail simply to know where she is
when she finds a customer. This poor woman,
offered for sale, expects to be <i>confined</i> in
a few weeks. She has a husband and mother,
but neither of them are allowed to go into the
jail to visit her. The husband tried to talk
with her through the grated window, the other
day, but was driven off by some menial of the
establishment. Amanda, the slave-woman, is
a member of the Methodist Church, which
takes the name of Bethlehem. I hear she is
in good standing in the Church, and sustains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
a fair and good character generally. The
mistress&mdash;the owner&mdash;the trader&mdash;who is she?
She is Miss A. B., a venerable spinster, a few
years ago from Virginia, and now residing in
this city. She brought with her this woman,
her mother, and two or three children, upon
whose wages she has lived for years past, and
now proposes to put Amanda in her pocket.
She (Miss A. B.) is a member of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, belongs to the M&rsquo;Kendree
Chapel congregation, and attends <i>class</i> regularly.
I am glad to say some of the brethren
are a little <i>stirred</i> about this transaction.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Elliott</i>,
<i>page 73.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A <i>little stirred</i>!&rdquo; Indeed! One would think
they would have stirred that villainous woman
out of the Church in short metre, or stirred out
of it themselves. But no, they were <i>only</i> &ldquo;<i>a little</i>
stirred!&rdquo;</p>

Slavery and the Church.<br />
<span class="smaller">OBJECTIONS TO THE EXCLUSION OF SLAVEHOLDERS
ANSWERED.</span></h2>

<p>1. It has been objected that fellowship should
not be withdrawn from <i>all</i> slaveholders, because
some of them are exceedingly kind to
their slaves. To this it may be answered that
it is impossible for a master to be really very
kind to those he holds in slavery, because the
<i>holding</i> of them in that relation is <i>extreme</i> unkindness.
A kind slaveholder? What entitles
him to that character? Does he renounce the
claim of <i>property</i> in his slaves? No. Does
he <i>hire</i> them to work for him and <i>pay</i> them
when the work is done? No. Does he open
a school on his plantation for their mental and
moral culture? No. Does he permit his slaves
to instruct each other in the rudiments of education?
No. Does he use his influence to
have the diabolical laws enacted to crush the
manhood out of the colored man, repealed?
No. Does he secure his slaves against the
chances of the inter-state slave trade&mdash;against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
sale at auction for his debts&mdash;against the lash
of a Legree? No. What then entitles him to
the character of a <i>kind</i> slaveholder? Why he
simply treats them as a good man treats a fine
horse or a favorite dog. He feeds them well,
works them moderately, whips but little, but
robs them of <i>all</i>! We abuse language when
we say&mdash;a <i>benevolent</i> robber, a <i>gentlemanly</i> pickpocket,
an <i>honorable</i> pirate or a <i>kind</i> slaveholder.</p>

<p>The poet, <i>Longfellow</i>, while traveling in Va.,
became acquainted with an honest old slave
owned by a fine specimen of a kind, Christian,
Presbyterian slaveholder. Said he:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calling at a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop for a small
job of work, I found the smith was a slave.
On inquiring to whom I should make payment,
he told me I might to him. His practice was
to receive all the money paid at the shop, and
pay it over to his master at night. I asked
him how his master knew whether he rendered
a just account. He replied, that he knew him
too well not to trust him. That, as wrong as
his master did by him, it was no excuse for him
to do wrong by his master. He could deceive
his master, but he could not deceive God, to
whom he must render his final account. He
said he was a Baptist, and had regular family
prayers. His master was a Presbyterian, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
whom he gave credit for good usage and good
training. But as he had faithfully served him
fifty years, he did think that he ought to have
the remainder of his days to himself. He regretted
that he could not read the Bible; and I
was pained to hear him attempt to quote it, he
made such blunders. The tears started in the
eyes of the poor man as he spoke of his hard
condition, and looked forward to death only for
release from his bondage. He thanked God
that he had no children to inherit his ignorance
and servitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kindness of certain slaveholders might
be mere favorably considered if it were productive
of any permanent practical benefits to
the slave; but while it leaves him in the depth
of his wretchedness,&mdash;exposed to all the horrors
of the worst form of slavery, it is a meritless
thing&mdash;unworthy the name of kindness.
The kind slaveholder knows that when he dies
his slaves will be sold at auction together with
his horses, cattle, and plantation. What avails
his fancied kindness when he knows the horrible
chances to which he subjects his helpless
victims. And how deeply guilty is he in the
sight of God for refusing to break every yoke
when he has the opportunity! To illustrate
this thought and show the sequel of kind slaveholding
we will subjoin a sketch of a woman&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
history who was the property of a <i>kind</i> slaveholder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A kind slave-master, in one of the Carolinas,
had a large family, of various colors,
some enslaved, some free. One of the slaves
was his favorite daughter, and much accomplished.
Dying, he willed his heir, her brother,
to provide for her handsomely, and make her
free. But her brother was a slave-master, and
she was a slave. He kept and debauched her.
At the end of four years he got tired of her;
and that notorious slave-dealer, Woolfork,
coming down to collect a drove, he sold his
sister to him. &ldquo;There is her cottage,&rdquo; said he
to Woolfork; &ldquo;she is a violent woman. I don&rsquo;t
like to go near her; go and carry her off by
yourself.&rdquo; Woolfork strode into the cottage,
told her of the fact and ordered her to prepare.
She was dreadfully agitated. He urged her to
hasten. She arose and said, &lsquo;White man, I
don&rsquo;t believe you. I don&rsquo;t believe that my
brother would thus sell me, and his children.
I will not believe unless he come himself.&rsquo;&mdash;Woolfork
coolly went, and required her brother&rsquo;s
presence. The seducer, the tyrant came,
and, standing at the door, confirmed the slaveholder&rsquo;s
report. &lsquo;And is it true? and have you
sold me?&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;Is it really possible?
Look at this child! Don&rsquo;t you see in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
feature the lineaments of its father? Don&rsquo;t
you know that your blood flows in its veins?
Have you, have you sold me?&rsquo; The terrible
fact was repeated by her master. &lsquo;These children,&rsquo;
said she, with a voice only half articulate,
&lsquo;shall never be slaves.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never mind
about <i>that</i>,&rsquo; said Woolfork, &lsquo;go and get ready.
I shall only wait a few minutes longer.&rsquo; She
retired with her children. The two white men
continued alone. They waited. She returned
not. They grew tired of waiting, and followed
her to her chamber. There they found their
victims beyond the reach of human wickedness,
bedded in their blood.&rdquo;&mdash;(Anti-Slavery
Record.)</p>

<p>2. Slaveholders ought not to be excluded
from the church, it is argued, because their
views and feelings on the subject of slavery
have been corrupted by the prevalence of this
popular sin. They are not, it is maintained,
individually responsible&mdash;the fault&mdash;the sin,
the shame attaches to a false public morality.
Dr. McClintock offers this objection in the following
words: &ldquo;Their position,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has
the eminent unhappiness of almost necessitating
a feeble or corrupt moral sense on this
subject; they are carried along by a great
movement that absorbs their individuality, so
to speak; the personal conscience is lost in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the general sense of the community. The
great work to be done is to purify that general
sense; not to curse and malign individual
slaveholders, but to break up the false public
morality in which the system finds its main
support.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>We answer that no man is excusable for
falling in with a &ldquo;great movement&rdquo; which is
manifestly wicked. Noah, Lot, Abraham and
Elijah were not carried along with sin in this
way. Their moral sense was neither enfeebled
nor corrupted by the prevailing vices. The
apostles did not lose their &ldquo;personal conscience&rdquo;
in the &ldquo;general sense&rdquo; of idolatrous
communities, in the midst of which they labored.
And in <i>no case</i> does the Bible excuse a
sinner because of the prevalence of sin.&mdash;Idolaters
were not taken into church because
that vice was sustained by law and prevailing
custom. And he who lived in Corinth in the
days of St. Paul, found himself in the midst
of gross, shameless sensuality&mdash;and it was
quite easy for such a person to fall in with the
vices for which that city was notorious; and
some Christians did fall in with those vices.
But did St. Paul excuse them, and forbid their
expulsion from the church, throwing the blame
of their conduct upon the prevailing vice? Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he ordain that until the &ldquo;general sense&rdquo; were
purified, the &ldquo;fornicator,&rdquo; the &ldquo;incestuous person&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;drunkard&rdquo; must remain in the
church? By no means. He knew that the
<i>public</i> conscience was made up of <i>individual</i>
consciences&mdash;that public corruption was the
aggregate of individual corruption&mdash;and hence
that the only possible method of reaching and
purifying the general sense, was by reaching
and purifying the individual sense. And
hence individual purity was required as a condition
of church membership. Churches now
proceed precisely upon this principle in relation
to all sins, however prevalent, slavery
excepted; and no good reason can be offered
for making it an exception. And if slaveholders
<i>have</i> an enfeebled moral sense, which is
certainly the case, it is because the ministry
and church have been recreant to duty and
truth, and have said to them &ldquo;peace, peace,
when God had not spoken peace.&rdquo; The only
way to prevent them from being swept along
by the flood tides of this devastating iniquity
until they launch upon the shoreless sea of
wrath, is to sound the alarm! But alas, those
watchmen who have their ear are apt to
say to them, do not be alarmed&mdash;the &ldquo;false
<i>public</i> morality&rdquo; will be a satisfactory apology
for your sins! When asked by the judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
why you were an oppressor, you can answer,
that you only followed the prevailing
example!</p>

<p>3. Slavery, it is objected, is a <i>political</i> question
and hence the church ought not to meddle
with it. We answer, that slavery is not only
a political, but a moral question&mdash;it is a question
concerning the rights of man, and all that
concerns <i>man</i> concerns a christian. Temperance
is made a political question, should the
church therefore fellowship the drunkard? The
observance of the Sabbath is a political question&mdash;must
the church therefore drop it, lest it
be entangled with politics? The same may be
said of gambling, perjury and theft.</p>

<p>4. But, says one, the laws uphold slavery,
and whatever of blame attaches to slaveholding
is justly chargeable to the laws. To this
it is answered that slaveholders are the <i>makers
of their own laws</i>, and hence are responsible
for them. But if they had no voice in the
government it would be impossible to shift the
responsibility of slaveholding upon the laws,
because, in the first place, a good man cannot
innocently avail himself of the provisions of
laws which permit him to injure his fellow
creatures; and in the next place, the laws
compel no one to hold slaves. They allow it,
but do not require it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>5. But some, it is urged, are slaveholders
from necessity, hence they ought not to be
blamed. This cannot be. The laws do not
compel people to buy, steal, trade for, receive
as a gift, or inherit slaves. Any one may refuse
to own this kind of property unless he is
an idiot or a child. And if by any means a
man finds himself in possession of slaves he
can emancipate them. It is not far to the
free states. Why do not those pious Methodists
and Presbyterians, who are always talking
of the impossibility of &ldquo;<i>getting rid</i>&rdquo; of their
slaves, permit the abolitionists to help them?
They would cheerfully pilot them, or give
them a free passage on the Under-Ground
Railroad! But all those pious slaveholders
from necessity are ready to lynch or imprison
any man who may undertake to release them
from the &ldquo;necessary evils&rdquo; of slavery. A slaveholder
from necessity is one who holds slaves
<i>because holding</i> them is a necessary condition of
<i>robbing</i> them.</p>

<p>6. But the church has no right to ask a man
to give away his property and impoverish himself.
Yes, the church has a right to require a
man to restore stolen property, and this is the
kind of property slaves are. As to impoverishing
slaveholders, there is danger of that, but
poverty is no crime and is often good for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
soul. It is better to be a Lazarus in this
world with his future, than a Dives with his
future. And besides, there is no law of God
allowing a man to roll in wealth acquired by
robbery.</p>

<p>7. Nothing can be said against some slaveholders
<i>only</i> that they hold slaves. In every
other respect they are christian-like in their
conduct, and it seems hard to exclude such fine
people from the church.</p>

<p>Alas that any christian should speak of
slaveholding as &ldquo;<i>only</i>&rdquo; a small objection. But
one sin may ruin the soul. Some men are in
every respect excellent persons <i>except</i> that they
are addicted to intemperate habits, to lying,
or to licentiousness&mdash;shall they therefore be
excused for their besetting sin, and allowed to
indulge it? One who has cheated a poor
white neighbor out of only one year&rsquo;s toil,
ought never to be admitted into the church
until he makes restitution. So in the case of
a slaveholder&mdash;let him be just to <i>every</i> creature
of God&mdash;let him give up his idol or serve it in
its appropriate temple, and not disgrace the
church of God with its image and worshiper.</p>

<p>8. It has been maintained that slaveholders
should be taken into the church that they may
come under the direct influence of the gospel,
the tendency of which is to destroy slavery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
We answer&mdash;<i>a.</i> The same reason might be
urged with equal force for the admission of the
drunkard, liar, thief or adulterer.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Experience proves that slaveholders, when
admitted to church fellowship, are not more
likely to emancipate their slaves than others.
They are apt to settle down in the belief that
it is right to hold slaves, and the height of impertinence
for any one to meddle with them
about it. A minister in Kentucky, Rev. Mr.
Fee, who is well acquainted with this subject
from experience and actual observation, says
of the slaveholder&mdash;&ldquo;The way to lull his conscience
on the subject is, to bring him into the
church in the practice of his sin. I know repeated
instances of persons whose consciences
and hearts, at the time of their awakening,
seemed to be tender on the subject of slaveholding.
But after they had been fully received,
and a few comfortable meetings passed
over, they became wholly indifferent; and after
hearing or reading one or two pro-slavery sermons,
declaring slavery to be a Bible institution,
they were almost ready to seize the torch,
and apply the fires of persecution to the individual
who would disturb their Zion. The
place to induce the slaveholder to give up his
sin is at the time, or before, he enters the door
of the church; before he has been pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
as being in a salvable state; for &lsquo;all that a
man hath will he give for his life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this is no abstruse question as &ldquo;cotton
Divines&rdquo; would persuade us. Slaveholding is
a wicked business and must be treated as
such. It is impossible to treat it as such while
fellowship is extended to slaveholders. The
christian is bound to refuse that fellowship. If
any branch of the church officially or practically
sanctions slavery and endorses the piety
of slaveholders, then, in order to be consistent
and safe, a christian must come out of that
church, because in it, he will be a partaker of
its sins and a sufferer of its plagues.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
Political Duties of Christians.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EXTIRPATION OF SLAVERY FROM THE WORLD.</span></h2>

<p>Civil government is necessary to the preservation,
prosperity and safety of society. In
some important sense, &ldquo;the powers that be,
are ordained of God.&rdquo; It does not appear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the Creator has established any specific <i>form</i>
of government, but the genius of christianity
is evidently democratic. The leading <i>objects</i>
of government are defined to be &ldquo;the punishment
of evil doers and the praise of them that
do well.&rdquo; When a government fails to protect
and encourage the good and to punish evil
doers,&mdash;when it becomes a mighty engine of
oppression, the object of its institution is frustrated.</p>

<p>In the United States the voters are responsible
for the character of the government. The
people are the sovereign rulers. The ballot
box controls legislation. If our country is
badly governed it is the people&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>The free white people of America are responsible
for the existence of American slavery.
They could at the ballot box break
every yoke. They have the power to release
more than three millions of slaves and thereby
make heaven and earth rejoice!</p>

<p>A weighty responsibility, therefore, rests
upon voters in relation to slavery. If it continue,
it will be because they shall will it, and
express that will at the ballot box. He who
votes for a representative that is pledged to
sustain slavery, becomes responsible for that
representative&rsquo;s acts on the slavery question.
The responsibility cannot be shifted or dodged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Representatives consult the will of their constituents
and act as they wish them to act.
They are only the people&rsquo;s agents, the echo of
the people&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts how can a christian
vote for a slaveholder or a friend of slavery?
How can he, by his vote, say that
slavery shall be perpetual? Every pulsation of
a christian&rsquo;s heart beats in harmony with liberty;
he could not have slaves in his own
hands. How then can he, how dare he, by his
vote, chain them and deliver them over to the
slave driver? It is mean and wicked for a
strong man to beat a weak one, but it is
equally as mean and wicked to <i>hold</i> the weak
man so that the strong one may beat him at
his leisure and with ease. So it is bad to own
a slave and tax his sinews, sweat and blood,
to beat and bruise him, but it is equally wrong
to hold the slave while the southern slaveholder
does the same thing. Hence, he who
votes for pro-slavery representatives, votes for
slavery and all its swarms of evils, and is indirectly
a slaveholder himself.</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly understood, then, that
political power has been entrusted to the christian
people of America by the God of nations,
who holds them responsible for its proper exercise;
and that acting politically is a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
business, affecting the interests directly, in this
country, of twenty millions of freemen, and
more than three millions of slaves; and also
affecting indirectly, the interests of the whole
human family.</p>

<p>If the supporters of slavery continue to control
the policy of the American government;
to trample under foot the &ldquo;higher law;&rdquo; to
render the Declaration of Independence a nullity;
to denationalize liberty; to nationalize
slavery and perpetuate and extend it; and
thus to belie all our professions of Democracy,
and render this government a Godless tyrant,
delighting in crushed hopes and hearts&mdash;then
the whole human race may weep. That our
government has been progressing toward this
terrible consummation for the last thirty years
is but too evident.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence is a
sound anti-slavery document. It does not
regard the right of all men to liberty as an
unsettled opinion or a question to be proved
by abstruse argument, but pronounces it a
&ldquo;<span class="small">SELF EVIDENT TRUTH</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Constitution in <i>form</i> if not in fact,
pretty fully embodies the sentiments of the
Declaration. The word slave is not found in
it, and it was kept out not accidentally, but
purposely. The framers of the Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
carefully guarded that instrument against any
endorsement of slavery. In the convention
which formed the Constitution, Gov. Morris of
Pennsylvania said, &ldquo;He never would concur
in upholding domestic slavery. It was a nefarious
institution.&rdquo; Mr. Getry, of Massachusetts,
in the same convention said, &ldquo;we had
nothing to do with the conduct of the States
as to slavery, <i>but we ought to be very careful not
to give any sanction to it</i>.&rdquo; The idea that there
<i>could</i> be property in man was carefully excluded
from the Constitution. It was about
to be foisted into that instrument by the adoption
of a report of a committee fixing a tax on
importations. But Mr. <i>Sherman</i> was against
&ldquo;<i>acknowledging men to be property</i>, by taxing
them as such under the character of slaves.&rdquo;
<i>Madison &ldquo;thought it wrong to admit in the constitution
the idea that there could be property in
man.&rdquo;</i> But if the idea of property in man
was carefully excluded from the Constitution,
then it is clear that chattel slavery is not in
form recognized, much less established by that
instrument.</p>

<p>It is evident that the framers of the Constitution
expected the speedy abolition of slavery;
and hence, while providing in fact though
not in form, for its continuance under the constitution,
by virtue of <i>local</i> State laws, they so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
framed that instrument that it would not countenance
slavery or deny the glorious doctrines
of the immortal Declaration, which contained
what Mr. Sumner calls &ldquo;the national heart,
the national soul, the national will, and the
national voice.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><i>Washington</i> said &ldquo;That it was among his
<i>first wishes</i> to see some plan adopted, by
which slavery may be <i>abolished</i> by law.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> regarded slavery as &ldquo;a sacrilegious
breach of trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Hamilton</i> considered slaves, &ldquo;though free by
the law of God, held in slavery by the laws of
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Jefferson</i> said that the &ldquo;abolition of domestic
slavery was the greatest object of desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Patrick Henry</i> said&mdash;&ldquo;I will not, I cannot
justify it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Benj. Franklin</i>, when 84 years of age, came
up before Congress with a petition from the
&ldquo;Abolition Society of Pennsylvania, praying
that body to countenance the restoration of
liberty to those unhappy men, who alone, in
this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual
bondage, and who, amidst the general joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of surrounding freemen are groaning in servile
subjection.&rdquo; This petition besought Congress
to &ldquo;step to the <span class="small">VERY VERGE</span> of the power
vested in them for <i>discouraging</i> every species
of traffic in the persons of our fellow men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These facts afford conclusive evidence, that
the founders of the American Republic did
not intend to fasten upon the object of their
toils, perils and sacrifices, a monster which
would speedily eat out its virtue, destroy its
vitality and overthrow it forever.</p>

<p>But the policy of the government has been
reversed. Millions of acres of territory have
been purchased and annexed to make room
for slavery, which has become a great national
pet&mdash;the god before whom aspiring politicians
must kneel and worship as a condition of political
elevation.</p>

<p>The President of the United States and his
Cabinet, the Supreme Court, and both Houses
of Congress are all under the control of the
Slaveocracy. No man can be a President of
the United States unless he bows the knee and
swears upon the altar of this modern Baal.
Zeal for the infamous Fugitive Slave Law is
now a particular test of political orthodoxy.
A Congressman who advocates the principles
of Washington, Franklin and Jefferson is considered
as standing outside of any &ldquo;healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
organization&rdquo; and is not deemed worthy of a
place on the most insignificant Congressional
committee. Our government has been thoroughly
changed from an anti-slavery to a pro-slavery
government.</p>

<p>In view of these facts how important that
the concentrated moral and political power of
every American christian be brought to the
rescue of our great Republic from the sin and
shame of its present position.</p>

<p>Christians, in the States where slavery exists,
are under obligations to use their whole
political and moral power to bring about the
speedy repeal of the entire slave code. That
code is a miserable barbarism and should be
swept away forever from the statutes of Christian
States. My christian brethren in Virginia,
Kentucky and Missouri, are you prepared
to use all the power, moral and political,
with which you are entrusted, as you shall answer
to God, for the emancipation of your suffering
fellow citizens? Your political influence
must tell somewhere! Remember <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Christians in the free States are obliged to
do what is in their power for the repeal of all
laws which bear upon the colored man because
he is a <i>colored</i> man. The word &ldquo;white&rdquo; ought
to be erased from the statutes of all christian
States. All &ldquo;black laws&rdquo; are anti-democratic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
anti-christian, and not only insult and annoy,
but discourage the colored man and obstruct
his progress in the path of improvement.&mdash;Christian
brethren of the free States, you have
not done your duty toward your colored
brother. You have sustained laws which gall
his neck as a heavy yoke. You have treated
him as an alien and an enemy. Will you henceforth
do him justice, as you shall answer to
God?</p>

<p>Christian citizens of all the States are directly
responsible for the existence of slavery
in the District of Columbia, and they should
not be content until that foul pollution is
wiped away from the Capital of our country.
Slavery at Washington is especially a national
disgrace, a blistering shame, a satire upon our
professions.</p>

<p>When the foreign minister or visitor comes
to our country, and goes to Washington, he
sees in the streets, at the hotels, and everywhere,
a poor, stupid, oppressed people, whose
very speech and looks betray their ignorance
and servility. Ah! Is this American freedom?
Equality? Republicanism? Upon inquiry, he
finds that one-seventh of all the people are in
this state of servile wretchedness.</p>

<p>And when a member of Congress from a
free State goes to the proud Capital of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
country, he beholds passing by the tall and
splendid buildings of the government, droves of
men, women and children, chained together,&mdash;some
sullenly indifferent to their fate&mdash;others
weeping as if their hearts would break.&mdash;Who
are these? American citizens!</p>

<p>Men, as white as some members of Congress,
and women as fair as their wives and as
virtuous as their daughters, are cried off at auction
to the highest bidder, in Washington!</p>

<p>There our senators and representatives sit
and legislate, in sight of the slave prison, and
slave market&mdash;in hearing of the clanking of
chains, and coffles,&mdash;and of the wail of slave
mothers, weeping for their children, because
they are</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;Gone, gone, sold and gone.&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They are also responsible for the extension
of slavery into territory now free. If they go
not to the utmost verge of their power to save
the Lord&rsquo;s free earth from the overspreading
and blighting curse of slavery, they cannot but
be execrated by an enlightened posterity.</p>

<p>But more than all this. A christian is a
citizen of the world, and hence is required to
employ the whole force of his moral and political
power for the extirpation of slavery
from every State in the Union, and from every
country on the globe. The influence of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
intelligent, active christian citizen is worldwide.
He cannot be the dupe or tool of any
party; he is never shackled by party organizations;
he does not commit the keeping of
his conscience to political leaders. He sincerely
loves God, believes the Bible, and loves
his fellow-men, because they are men. Prejudice,
caste, and all other relics of barbarism,
he has thrown away. He talks, votes and prays
for universal liberty and righteousness. In
the pulpit, in the shop, on the farm, anywhere,
everywhere the whole weight of his influence
is thrown against slavery in the territories, in
the District of Columbia, in the States, and
against it wherever it exists in the world. As
he seeks for the physical, intellectual and
moral improvement and happiness of all men,
he must desire intensely the speedy extirpation
of slavery from the earth.</p>

<p>Christian voter, when you approach the ballot
box, think of the three millions of bondmen
who are holding up their hands &ldquo;all
manacled and bleeding,&rdquo; pleading to you for
deliverance!</p>

<p>Many persons, who appear to be sensible
of the evils of slavery, seem utterly at a loss
for some feasible method of abolishing it. &ldquo;It
is here in our midst,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;and how are
we to get rid of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this question we have a plain scriptural
answer. <span class="smcap">&ldquo;Loose the bands of wickedness,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;undo
the heavy burdens,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Let the oppressed
go free,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;break every yoke,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;proclaim liberty
throughout all the land, unto all the
inhabitants thereof.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Immediate, unconditional, universal emancipation
is the only just, the only reasonable
and the only possible method of adjusting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
slavery question. To this measure the people
of the United States <i>must</i> come. A general
Jubilee is inevitable. Slavery is an unmitigated
wrong. Every element of it is at variance
with the happiness of man and the law
of God. It is without a single redeeming principle,
and hence its destruction&mdash;its total annihilation
is necessary.</p>

<p>Since the gigantic wrongs of slavery have
been so generally made known as somewhat
to arouse the public conscience from its long
sleep, some writers, anxious to preserve the
system, have proposed to <i>reform</i> it. They say,
&ldquo;Slavery, of itself, is a very innocent relation,
but its evils are horrible. Let us correct the
evils and preserve the system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But slavery cannot be reformed, so as to
make it a tolerable institution because its essential
feature&mdash;viz, <i>property in a human being</i>,
is, wherever imposed, an outrageous, an insufferable
wrong. Who would think of reforming
robbery&mdash;of making laws to regulate robbers
in their trade&mdash;and to prevent brutal men
from engaging in it? What if it should be
enacted by grave senators that none but gentlemen
should rob, and that they must do it
genteelly&mdash;using no <i>unnecessary</i> cruelty or coercion?
All the world would laugh such senators
to scorn. But slavery is from beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to end a system of robbery, which it is as impossible
to reform, so as to take away its
&ldquo;evils,&rdquo; as it is to so reform piracy as to destroy
its evils, and make it a humane, just and
christian trade.</p>

<p>But the American slaves, it is maintained,
are <i>not prepared for freedom</i>. This objection is
without foundation. God <i>creates</i> men free, and
sends them forth into the world with such endowments
as are needed in a state of freedom,
and as are suited to <i>no other</i> state. To say that
a race, which God has <i>created</i> free, is unprepared
for freedom is to reproach the Maker. Freedom
is the native element of man. And</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;The heavens, the earth, man&rsquo;s heart and sea,</div>
<div class="i0">Forever cry, <i>let all be free</i>!&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Not prepared for freedom?&rdquo; This has
been the watchword of oppressors in all ages.
The &ldquo;people,&rdquo; the uninformed &ldquo;masses,&rdquo; have,
in the estimation of tyrants, always been prepared
for slavery and injustice of every kind,
but never for freedom. And it has ever been
their policy to render them less fit for any station
or any responsibility in life. They never
put forth an effort to prepare their victims for
any higher business than obsequious submission
to usurped authority. True to this spirit,
those who are most noisy about the unfitness
of slaves for freedom, are most zealous for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
maintenance of those odious laws and usages
which shut them out from all chance of mental
and moral culture.</p>

<p>And if the slaves are unprepared for freedom,
what is to prepare them for it? Their
present degradation is owing to slavery, and
it is not likely that the continuance of the
<i>cause</i> of their degradation will elevate them.
Remove the cause, and the effect will cease.
Emancipate the colored man, open to him our
schools and colleges, place before him motives
for action such as animate freemen, and swell
the hearts of Christians, give him an <i>opportunity</i>
and he will prove himself every whit a
<span class="small">MAN</span>. How mean and hypocritical the objection,
that slaves are not prepared for freedom,
when we employ the whole weight of our laws
and prejudices to crush out their manhood, and
as far as possible unfit them for any condition
except that of working animals.</p>

<p>But thousands of slaves have fled from their
oppressors, and, in the midst of the greatest
difficulties and embarrassments, have not only
proved themselves prepared for freedom, but
also to take a position amongst the most cultivated
and honored freemen.</p>

<p>The half-free colored people of the United
States <i>prove</i> themselves worthy of all the
rights of American citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>There are now in Canada about 35,000 fugitive
slaves; and no people have ever entered
upon the possession of freedom under more
embarrassing circumstances. They were born
in chains. The iron yoke had galled their
necks. Their backs had felt the keen lash.
In their flight they were pursued by hungry
blood-hounds and more hungry marshals.&mdash;Naked,
broken in spirit, impoverished and uneducated,
they reached a cold, ungenial clime.
But they were free! And those 35,000 escaped
slaves are rapidly improving in wealth, intelligence,
and in every social virtue. In the town
of Buxton 130 families reside who own a body
of 9,000 acres of land. The fugitive slaves
of Canada West now own 25,000 acres of
land. Were they not prepared for freedom?</p>

<p>Immediate emancipation worked admirably
in the British West Indies. The masters were
not murdered by the emancipated slaves, as
was predicted, but good order reigned everywhere.
The liberated people have been rapidly
improving in intelligence and wealth.&mdash;The
terrible wrongs and miseries of slavery
are no more. Rev. Mr. Richardson, a missionary
in Jamaica, speaking of the moral condition
of those islands, says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marriage is much more common than formerly,
and the blessings of the family and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
social relations are much more extensively
enjoyed. The Sabbath is also more generally
observed. The means of education and religious
instruction are better enjoyed, although
but little appreciated and improved by the
great mass of the people. It is also true, that
the moral sense of the people is becoming
somewhat enlightened. But while this is true,
yet their moral condition is very far from being
what it ought to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our brightest hopes and fondest anticipations
must and will centre around the <span class="small">YOUTH</span>
of this island. I see the hand of Providence
steadily urging onward, with resistless might,
the car of Progress. Gaunt Prejudice and
grim Superstition gradually give way; Darkness
and Error recede before the sunlight of
Truth; and even the demon of Lust and the
giant Intemperance (twin brothers in Satan&rsquo;s
family) are bereft of their power, and chained
for a season. I see intelligence, purity, and
piety supplanting ignorance, licentiousness,
and irreligion, and this moral waste becoming
transformed until it blooms and flourishes as
the garden of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediate emancipation?&rdquo; exclaims a fearful
friend, &ldquo;that will never do! Murder,
amalgamation, and many other evils will be
inevitable consequences of such a measure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Let us colonize the slaves. Send them back
to their own country.&rdquo; To these objections it
may be answered,</p>

<p>1. Colored men are not more inclined to
murder than are white men. Africans have
the same natural dispositions which distinguish
other races.</p>

<p>2. Many masters have emancipated their
slaves, and thereby secured their undying
affection. Liberated slaves have never turned
with bloody hands upon their liberators.</p>

<p>3. In the West India Islands 800,000 slaves
were emancipated in one day, and although
sixteen years have since elapsed, none of the
terrible massacres which were predicted by
the opponents of the measure have occurred.</p>

<p>4. This fear of the vengeance of emancipated
slaves arises, doubtless, from a guilty
conscience&mdash;or a feeling that it is richly deserved.
A highwayman robs a man, and then
says, if I let him go he may have me arrested
and punished, therefore I will kill him. Americans
say, on the same principle, we have most
terribly abused our slaves, and hence, if we
let them go they will retaliate, therefore, we
must continue the wrong for self preservation!</p>

<p>5. As to amalgamation we have only to say
that slavery is an extensive system of forced
amalgamation. In the free States this much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
dreaded evil is of rare occurrence. Immediate
emancipation would speedily arrest the very
thing here deprecated.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The colonization scheme is impracticable.
Between three and four millions of people can
never be shipped off to Africa. It is impracticable
to send even the annual increase of the
free colored population. There are in America
now about twelve millions of colored people,
and there is no power, civil or ecclesiastical,
which can carry them away to Africa.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A few
will go and ought to go as missionaries, but
the great and rapidly increasing masses are
firmly planted on this continent and here they
must remain.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Forcible colonization is wrong. Colored
people have the same right to live in America
that white people have. The Creator made
the earth for the habitation of man, and He
has never surrendered his ownership of it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
any government. The colored man has a
right to live in any country on the globe&mdash;a
right derived from the Creator. Has God said
that every race under heaven may have a home
in America but the African? Never. It is
impertinent as well as wicked for one people
to say to another, &ldquo;you shall not live in this
State, nor on this continent.&rdquo; Such people
arrogate to themselves a prerogative which
Jehovah only possesses.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The present popular scheme of colonization
leaves unquestioned the title of the slaveholder,
encourages the doctrine that the Bible
sanctions the institution, appeals to the basest
prejudices of the American people to induce
them to countenance the scheme, and encourages
the enactment of such laws as now disgrace
the statutes of several of the free States,
in order, it would seem, to harrass the free colored
man until he shall be compelled to flee
from the land of his birth to a distant shore
for refuge. One who speaks what he knows,
says,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak the words of soberness and truth
when I say that the most inveterate, the most
formidable, the deadliest enemy of the peace,
prosperity, and happiness of the colored population
of the United States, is that system of
African colonization which originated in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
is perpetuated by a worldly, Pharaoh-like policy
beneath the dignity of a magnanimous and
Christian people;&mdash;a system which receives
much of its vitality from <i>ad captandum</i> appeals
to popular prejudices, and to the unholy, groveling
passions of the canaille;&mdash;a system that
interposes every possible obstacle in the way
of the improvement and elevation of the colored
man in the land of his birth;&mdash;that instigates
the enactment of laws whose design and
tendency are obviously to annoy him, to make
him feel, while at home, that he is a stranger
and a pilgrim&mdash;nay more,&mdash;to make him
&lsquo;wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind,
and naked;&rsquo;&mdash;to make him &lsquo;a hissing and a
by-word,&rsquo; &lsquo;a fugitive and a vagabond&rsquo; throughout
the American Union;&mdash;a system that is
so irreconcilably opposed to the purpose of
God in making &lsquo;of <i>one</i> blood all nations for
to dwell on <i>all</i> the face of the earth,&rsquo; that
when the dying slaveholder, under the lashes
of a guilty conscience, would give to his slaves
unqualified freedom, it wickedly interposes,
and persuades him that &lsquo;to do justly and love
mercy&rsquo; would be to inflict an irreparable injury
upon the community, and that to do his
duty to God and his fellow-creatures, under
the circumstances, he should bequeath to his
surviving slaves the cruel alternative of <i>either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
expatriation to a far-off, pestilential clime, with
the prospect of a premature death, or perpetual
slavery, with its untold horrors, in his native
land</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Watkins.</i></p>

<p>Many objections are offered against immediate
emancipation, but they are evidently
mere <i>excuses</i>. This may be laid down as a
safe rule: <i>Offer no objection to the manumission
of slaves which would not satisfy you were you
yourselves the slaves to be manumitted.</i> Tried by
this reasonable and scriptural rule all apologies,
objections and excuses offered for the
perpetuation of human bondage, vanish away.
There can be no good reason advanced for the
continuance of this curse a single year longer.
Too long already has it dishonored our churches
and our country. Too many souls have been
already involved by it in hopeless ruin. Too
many generations of slaves have already gone
in sorrow and despair down to their graves.
Too long has the public conscience been debauched.
Justice, humanity and religion with
united voice call for immediate emancipation.</p>

<p>If our free institutions are to be preserved
they must be released from the folds and the
deadly charm of this monster serpent. Freedom
cannot flourish in its coils nor survive in
its slimy embrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Individual and national repentance and
reformation only can avert the terrible judgments
of an offended God. The cries of the
oppressed have gone up into the ears of the
Lord of Sabaoth, and he will be avenged
speedily.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;We have offended. O! my countrymen!</div>
<div class="i0">We have offended very grievously;</div>
<div class="i0">And been most tyrannous. From east to west</div>
<div class="i0">A groan of accusation pierces heaven!&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are not more than one hundred and
twenty thousand slaveholders in the United
States, and it would be easy for them to settle
this whole question in one year or even in a
day. Let them simply be honest, be just,
obey the Bible, overcome their pride, avarice,
prejudices and lusts, and the work will be
done. The example of <i>Freeborn Garretson</i> is
commended to the special attention of all
slaveholders, and especially of those who profess
religion. This good man says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I stood with a book in my hand, in the
act of giving out a hymn, this thought powerfully
struck my mind: &lsquo;It is not right for you
to keep your fellow-creatures in bondage; you
must let the oppressed go free.&rsquo; I knew it to
be that same blessed voice which had spoken to
me before. Till then I had not suspected that
the practice of slave-keeping was wrong; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
had not read a book on the subject, nor been
told so by any. I paused a minute, and then
replied, &lsquo;Lord, the oppressed shall go free.&rsquo;
And I was as clear of them in my mind, as if
I had never owned one. I told them they did
not belong to me, and that I did not desire
their services without making them a compensation.
I was now at liberty to proceed in
worship. After singing, I kneeled to pray.
Had I the tongue of an angel, I could not
fully describe what I felt: all my dejection,
and that melancholy gloom which preyed
upon me, vanished in a moment, and a divine
sweetness ran through my whole frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was God, not man, that taught me the
impropriety of holding slaves: and I shall
never be able to praise him enough for it. My
very heart has bled, since that, for slaveholders,
especially those who made a profession of
religion; for I believe it to be a crying sin.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />
What of the Night?<br />
<span class="smaller">HOPE THOU IN GOD.</span></h2>

<p>Are there any prospects that the long and
dreary night of American despotism will speedily
end in a joyous morning?</p>

<p>If we turn our eye towards the political
horizon we shall find it overspread with heavy
clouds portentous of evil to the oppressed.
The government of the United States is intensely
pro-slavery. The great political parties,
with which the masses of the people act,
vie with each other in their supple and obsequious
devotion to the slaveocracy. The wise
policy of the fathers of the Republic to confine
slavery within very narrow limits, so that it
would speedily die out and be supplanted by
freedom, has been abandoned; the whole spirit
of our policy has been reversed&mdash;and our national
government seems chiefly concerned for the
honor, perpetuation and extension of slavery.</p>

<p>The powerful religious denominations have
been following in the wake of the state. Their
ancient and bold testimony against slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
has been expurgated from their confessions
and disciplines, or completely neutralized.&mdash;Slavery
<i>as it is</i> receives their unqualified sanction.
The giant Christian publication societies
of the day so completely ignore the question
of slavery that a reader of all their books
would not suspect that millions of slaves are
groaning under an iron yoke in this country.
Dark as a starless, moonless midnight, is the
aspect presented by the heavens of the popular
religious denominations.</p>

<p>American prejudice is yet very powerful.
The polite, educated, and talented free colored
traveler is exposed, in most parts of the
Union, to the coarsest insults from this gaunt
demon. He feels everywhere its hellish power.
One who was more than twenty years a slave
presents in the following eloquent language a
true picture of the present anomalous condition
of the children of Ham in the midst of the
general joy of freedom:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hungarian, the Italian, the Irishman,
the Jew and the Gentile, all find in this goodly
land a home; and when any of them, or all
of them, desire to speak, they find willing ears,
warm hearts, and open hands. For these people,
the Americans have principles of justice,
maxims of mercy, sentiments of religion, and
feelings of brotherhood in abundance. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
for <i>my</i> poor people, (alas, how poor!)&mdash;enslaved,
scourged, blasted, overwhelmed, and
ruined, it would appear that America had
neither justice, mercy, nor religion. She has
no scales in which to weigh our wrongs, and
no standard by which to measure our rights....
Here, upon the soil of our birth, in
a country which has known us for two centuries,
among a people who did not wait for us
to seek them, but who sought us, found us,
and brought us to their own chosen land,&mdash;a
people for whom we have performed the humblest
services, and whose greatest comforts
and luxuries have been won from the soil by
our sable and sinewy arms,&mdash;I say, sir, among
such a people, and with such obvious recommendations
to favor, we are far less esteemed
than the veriest stranger and sojourner....
We are literally scourged beyond the beneficent
range of both authorities&mdash;human and
divine. We plead for our rights, in the name
of the immortal declaration of independence,
and of the written constitution of government,
and we are answered with imprecations and
curses. In the sacred name of Jesus we beg
for mercy, and the slave-whip, red with blood,
cracks over us in mockery.... We
cry for help to humanity&mdash;a common humanity,
and here too we are repulsed. American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
humanity hates us, scorns us, disowns and
denies, in a thousand ways, our very personality.
The outspread wing of American christianity,
apparently broad enough to give shelter
to a perishing world, refuses to cover us. To
us, its bones are brass, and its feathers iron.
In running thither for shelter and succor, we
have only fled from the hungry bloodhound
to the devouring wolf,&mdash;from a corrupt and
selfish world to a hollow and hypocritical
church.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Fred. Douglass.</i></p>

<p>But dark as is this picture, there is still
hope. The exorbitant demands of the slave
power, the extreme measures it adopts, the
deep humiliation to which it subjects political
aspirants, will produce a reaction. Inflated
with past success it is throwing off its mask
and revealing its hideous proportions. It is
now proving itself the enemy of <i>all</i> freedom.</p>

<p>The extreme servility of the popular churches
is opening the eyes of many earnest people
to the importance of taking a bolder position.
They are finding out that it is a duty to
come out from churches which sanction the
vilest iniquity that ever existed, or exhaust
their zeal for the oppressed in tame resolves,
never to be executed.</p>

<p>The truth is gaining ground that slaveholding
is a great sin, that slaveholders are great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
sinners, and that he who apologises for the
system is a participator in the guilt and
shame.</p>

<p>Free mission societies, reform publication
societies, and free churches are rising up all
over the country, in the free and in the slave
States. They take their stand upon a solid
Bible platform, and their power will be rapidly
augmented until the strongholds of oppression
will tremble at their approach.</p>

<p>Literature is coming to the rescue of the
slave, and even now is pleading his cause with
astonishing power in all the languages of
christendom.</p>

<p>Christianity is on the side of the slave, and
its true spirit is beginning to be practically
applied.</p>

<p>Thousands of devout persons are found day
and night pleading with God for the speedy
deliverance of the captive.</p>

<p>But a voice from heaven is heard saying,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hope thou in God.</span>&rdquo; God is on the side of
the oppressed. He will never abandon them.
He approves their cause, hears their cries, and
is interested in all their movements. Those
millions of colored Americans are now in the
fiery furnace, but He will bring them out.
From their house of bondage they will come
forth, and accomplish a glorious mission on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the earth. God has reserved for them some
of the grandest achievements in music, poetry,
science, arts, morals, freedom and religion.
Never has he permitted a people to be more
deeply humbled, and none will in the end be
more highly exalted. God&rsquo;s ways are not as
our ways. He can make the wrath of man to
praise him.</p>

<p>The day of deliverance is not distant. God
is stirring up the nations. The slavery question
is agitating the whole enlightened world.
It cannot be put to rest. Politicians pronounce
it dead and solemnly bury it, but it rises before
the third day and confronts them in every
assembly. Church councils resolve to let it
alone, but it will not let them alone. They
hate agitation, and cry for peace, but are
answered, &ldquo;<i>first pure, then peaceable</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God of liberty! hasten the hour when the
reddening East shall authorize the joyful announcement
to American bondsmen&mdash;&ldquo;<i>the morning
cometh</i>.&rdquo; Till then let us &ldquo;<span class="small">TOIL AND TRUST</span>.&rdquo;</p>

it. It may be observed, however, that the word &ldquo;<i>punished</i>,&rdquo;
is rendered in the marginal reading, &ldquo;avenged;&rdquo; and the
meaning of the law is that the interest the master had in the life of
the servant should be taken as <i>presumptive</i> evidence that he did not
intend to kill him, unless the case was very clear, and hence that he
should not be <i>avenged summarily</i>, by a relative of the servant, but be
regularly tried and punished by the appointed authorities.</p></div>
